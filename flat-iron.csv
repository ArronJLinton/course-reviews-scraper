8/15/2017, • Student , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: New York City ,Verified via GitHub,[object Object],[object Object],Just a pre-emptive note that, since I'm still an active student, I cannot comment on the efficacy of their job assistance.,So, I've noticed that many of the "most helpful" reviews are 1 to 2 star reviews from anonymous users stating that the curriculum is disorganized, their job reports are falsified, etc. After 11 weeks in the program, I can safely say that many of these are either trolls or people who are flat-out lazy. The curriculum is "disorganized" in the sense that you won't have instructors breathing down your neck to complete your labs; they expect that you're a functioning human being with an actual work ethic and desire to learn. The only things that are mandatory are lectures that help to reinforce what is learned from the labs and group projects that, again, help to reinforce what was learned in the three week module.,The program is amazing, but it's a lot of work in a short amount of time. To put it bluntly, if you aren't 100% dedicated, you won't make it.
8/4/2017, • Front End Developer , • Graduate , •  Course: Online Web Developer Program , •  Campus: Online ,Verified via GitHub,[object Object],[object Object],After evaluating all the options for coding boot camps I decided on Flatiron. The comprehensive curriculum and learn at your own pace were attractive to me. As is the job-guarantee. I was confident I could get done quickly and save myself some cash along the way, which I did.,Career services post graduation was top notch. In addition, I have access to this resource for as long as Flatiron exists (I think they'll be around a while).,One of the biggest things that impress developers I've spoken with about the program is the Test Driven Development built into the curriculum. Every lab has tests that must be passed to move forward. I can say I learned in a TDD & BDD environment which is something most other boot camps DO NOT do. Telling someone I have read thousands of tests is a big plus to a lot of employers.,I really enjoyed my time in the program and even though I have now achieved a full-time developer position I still run study groups part time as a Teaching Assistant. The community was such a big part of my success and I enjoy giving back to it, yes I know I get paid but still.
8/1/2017, • Student , •  Course: Community-Powered Bootcamp , •  Campus: Online ,Verified via GitHub,[object Object],[object Object],I completed the Flatiron Bootcamp Prep course.  The self-paced course is taught online through the Learn.co website and through the Flatiron Learn IDE.  It provides an introduction into Javascript and Ruby with a few sections on HTML/CSS.,I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the Bootcamp Prep and highly recommend it.  To me, the one standout feature was the Learn IDE.  I have tried a variety of free programming courses online covering a variety of languages; generally, most expect the student to set up their own development environment or to use an online interpreter.  However, Flatiron provides its own IDE (a customized Atom editor) that is fully integrated with the course.  ,When I finish coding a lesson assignment, I simply type "learn" into the Learn IDE's terminal to run tests on my code to check if it fulfills the assignment.  Once I pass all the tests, I type "learn submit" which pushes my code to GitHub.  Now, when I switch back to the Learn.co website, I see the lesson is already marked as complete.  My "offline" progress on my computer is automatically synced with my Flatiron Learn.co account.   ,Beyond the amazing user experience, I greatly appreciated how closely this system matches how a real programmer works.  The Learn IDE is based on Atom, a very popular editor used by actual programmers.,The big bonus was exposure to running test cases.,These aspects really helped set the Flatiron Bootcamp Prep course apart for me.
7/31/2017, •  Campus: Online ,Verified via LinkedIn,[object Object],[object Object],This course covered all of the fundamentals. Amazingly, whenever I had a question an instructor was there to answer. Instructors even had me share my screen for difficult problems. And this service was provided for free!
7/31/2017, • Student , •  Campus: Online ,Verified via GitHub,[object Object],[object Object],I have been teaching myself to code for several months now. I've bounced around through several online resources (Coursera, Codecademy, Free Code Camp, etc.) and they all helped but some moved too quickly through the material or got pretty advanced while I was still lacking a strong foundation, I started to search for more of a full program option, that's when I started looking into attending a coding bootcamp.,I looked into all of the reputable bootcamps, the in-person and online options, and narrowed it down to about 5. I signed up for information from those 5 and received the recommended prep courses from each. I completed a full prep course from my top choice bootcamp but didn't feel entirely prepared so I decided to try the other prep courses before submitting any applications.,Out of the others, 2 of them weren't really worth my time, they were just practice problems and gave me no information about the teaching style of the school. So I was left with Flatiron's prep course on Learn.co and another fully online school's course. They were both very well done and I went through several lessons on each but Flatiron's Learn.co was really everything I wanted so I focused on completing it first. ,The online prep was so thorough and really fun to move through. Each lesson built upon the previous and contained mini labs that helped solidify the concepts. At the end of each module there was a larger project to complete using all of the skills from the lessons, each lab helped build up to it but enough was definitely left open so I never felt like I was just filling in the blank. I really got to apply what I had learned and finally felt like I was building a solid foundation. ,After finishing the Bootcamp Prep I not only felt totally ready to apply to the bootcamps but Flatiron had also become my top choice school. I submitted 3 applications, completed the assessments, and received invitations to interview with all! I chose Flatiron :)
7/26/2017, • Student , •  Campus: Online ,Verified via GitHub,[object Object],[object Object],I tried out Flatiron School's free Bootcamp Prep Course and was surprised at how comprehensive the course was along with its online community which gave me directions and guidelines with the courses in real-time .  Among other free online programming resources, Flatiron's online course was a level above the rest in teaching style and it gave me confidence in pursuing a career in programming full-time.,Bootcamp Prep Course gave me confidence to know if programming was right for me,  the teaching styles and online community gave me the drive to becoming a Flatiron School Student.  
7/24/2017, • Front End Web Developer , • Student , •  Course: Online Web Developer Program , •  Campus: Online ,Verified via LinkedIn,[object Object],[object Object],The path that got me to FlatIron was not straight, nor flat. I had quit my job to attend a different (local) bootcamp that closed their local campus only a few weeks before my cohort was set to begin. I was in a hurry to find a good option, and knew I needed one that I could start within the next month, if not the next few days or weeks. There were only a few options that fit that criteria, and FlatIron was a standout among them because of timing, price, the job guarantee and reviews on CourseReport. ,I could not be happier that I enrolled in FlatIron's Online Web Developer program. The curriculum is extremely well designed, thoughtful, and will allow a student who's tech savvy and smart to get to the meat of programming extremely quickly. For students who need a bit more guidance, the curriculum is well supported, broad based, and offers a bevvy of resources for further study. Learn experts and instructors are available to help, but you need to be comfortable asking -- but know that they're all excited to help you learn and are well equipped to do so.  ,The community of fellow learners is also extremely helpful -- I recommend taking advantage of study groups, standups and checkins, and if possible, make a few friends on slack and keep in touch with them throughout the course. Because it's self-paced, you'll likely diverge in where you are, but the social support is priceless. ,Because the course is self-paced, it can be difficult to tell where you are. While I was enrolled, students working at a a full time schedule (40-60 hours a week) seemed to finish at a pace of around 16-18 weeks, with some eking in closer to the 12-14 mark. If you like milestones, keep track of what you're accomplishing and at what pace. ,Career support is valuable, especially if you're not highly motivated on your own. Whatever your motivation level, don't be afraid to advocate for yourself! As with any coaching experience, telling your coach the type of support you want in advance will help them give it to you. 
7/21/2017, • Instructor , • Graduate , •  Course: Online Web Developer Program , •  Campus: Online ,Verified via LinkedIn,[object Object],[object Object],I had dabbled in coding before joining flatiron. I had worked on WordPress sites and had a bit of experience with Ruby and Ruby on Rails using free online resources.,I remember how it felt to do web work before flatiron, and I'm really glad I decided to go through the online web developer program. I have so many more tools in my belt and I know what they do.  But, most importantly, I have learned how to approach problems that I don't have solutions for yet. I've gotten so much better at finding the right tool for a new problem.,The curriculum is scaffolded very well, gradually increasing in difficulty until you're able to build fully functional full stack web application with a high level understanding of how the pieces fit together.  Because of that understanding, when I see a problem I have an intuition about where the problem could be.,Flatiron gave me the confidence to dive into problems I haven't faced and build solutions for them.  And, because the curriculum is built around automated testing, I was able to look at lots of practical examples of how to write tests for functionality I wanted to build for my own applications. And because everything is on GitHub, we got a lot of practice using git.,All of that along with the amazing community support and dedication on the part of flatiron staff to constantly improving the experience for students, I highly recommend attending.,If you're worried about the online experience not providing enough support, I'd also like to point out that the platform has an ask a question feature built into the web application.  If you get stuck and need help, you can chat with one of the technical coaches and even do a screen share with them.  On that screen share, you can talk through the problem with them in real time as they look through your code and help you develop new debugging techniques to help you when you get stuck in the future. ,Disclaimer: I am currently working as one of those technical coaches, so if you check out the free Bootcamp Prep track at Flatiron, you may end up hopping on a screen share with me! I've really enjoyed  working with Flatiron because I've really seen a lot of improvement since I first started the curriculum in November 2015.  It is a group of kind, hard-working individuals who are truly dedicated to creating the best possible experience for students.,The Job Search support afterwards has been amazing. My career coach has helped me tremendously in sourcing new opportunities, preparing  for interviews, building up my online presence, managing the search and staying emotionally sane during the process.  I knew that I wanted to be involved in education, and they helped me land a job as an instructor for Girls Who Code in Los Angeles. , 
7/6/2017, • iOS Developer , • Graduate , •  Course: iOS Development Immersive , •  Campus: New York City ,Verified via LinkedIn,[object Object],[object Object],A fellow alum convinced me to give Flatiron a try because I'd recently been laid off when my previous company collapsed.  The first day I knew it was one of the best decisions of my life.  Fast-forward three months and I have a new job, am making 25k more a year than I was in my previous career, and genuinely enjoy the work that I do.  Go to some of their events, get a feel for their vibe, and if you're gut tells you to make the plunge then do it.  You won't regret it, and you'll work with some amazing people who push you to be the absolute best version of yourself.
7/6/2017, • Software Engineer , • Graduate , •  Course: Online Web Developer Program , •  Campus: Online ,Verified via GitHub,[object Object],[object Object],I attended Flatiron's Online Web Developer Program via Learn.co from August 2016 to April 2017 while working full time. Fully employed as of May 2017.,I'm fully aware that I go into full fangirl mode whenever I talk about Flatiron. What can I say? I had an amazing experience that I can honestly call life-changing. I went from a hobbyist coder to an employable programmer in less than a year, met tons of friends from all over the U.S. and the rest of the world, and laid the foundations for a great career.,What made it so great? ,
	,Don't get me wrong; it was a ton of work. I had an unrelated full-time job that I couldn't quit for financial reasons, so my life consisted of going to work and coming home to code for several months. My friends thought I had turned into a hermit. But it was absolutely worth it, and I'd recommend this program to anyone looking to get a head start on a career in web development.
7/5/2017, • Web Developer , • Graduate , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: New York City ,Verified via GitHub,[object Object],[object Object],I had dabbled with code before I went throught Flatiron, I built a few projects and went through many tutorials. Going through the Flatiron program took all of my knowledge and made it marketable. It helped me grasp the fundamentals that I needed in order to learn and write code at a much faster and deeper pace.,If you are interested in making money from coding, Flatiron is the place to be. The environment is warm and welcoming and very conducive to learning. The instructors are amazing (shoutout to Ian, JJ, Tracy, and Antoine). Every day was a fun interesting learning experience and I highly recommend this program for anyone looking to get started with coding as a career.  
5/7/2017, • Software Engineer , • Graduate , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: New York City ,Verified via GitHub,[object Object],[object Object],I attended the Web Development Immersive program beginning in September 2016 and got a job in software engineering in February 2017! The on-campus program really helped me provide me with a platform to learn with the most helpful instructors and other students who shared the same passion to learn coding/programming.,I was previously in banking for 5 years and the Flatiron School really allowed me to make a career change in such a short amount of time. I got my job through the very helpful career services team at the school.,The curriculum is strong despite some programming languages being a little old in an ever changing world of different technologies. Ruby on Rails provides a solid foundation for Object Oriented programming and for basic web development structure and an idea of what frameworks are. However, the school is constantly revising and updating their curriculum to try to stay up to date. The most relevant language taught that I actually use at my job is JavaScript, which is ubiquitous in all of the internet.,All in all, the 12 weeks are rigorous but necessary to have you effectively learn everything to prepare you for the tech industry. If you are serious about pursuing a career in web development or software engineering, the Flatiron School provided an absolutely wonderful experience. It's extremely effective and has the results to prove it!
4/26/2017, • Apprentice Software Engineer , • Graduate , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: New York City ,Verified via GitHub,[object Object],[object Object],I attended Flatiron's 12-week Full Stack Web Development Immersive Program back in September 2016, got a job last month, April 2017. ,On Curriculum , ,I liked how flatiron taught both Ruby and JavaScript. It's exactly what I wanted from a bootcamp. The lessons can be pretty challenging but they're doable. They ask you to build things from scratch like ORMs and later teach you that there are simpler ways to do this through abstraction or less code. The manner and organization helped me understand every line of code and why things are happening , rather than cool efficient methods immediately taught early on. The curriculum is meant to make you feel dumb for the first hour (or even the first 2 days haha!). But that's how everyone expects to feel knowing we're in an immersive program we hardly had any experience with. I love how the curriculum's structured and how it continually challenges the class. It worries us if we start finding things easy, cause it shouldn't. , ,On instructors , ,Our instructors are great. They articulate the process of code very well. Questions are highly appreciated no matter how "dumb" you think they are. They added one-on-ones for every student per week to check on you, how you are, if you've gotten the lessons right, quick assessments, not to kick you out but to explain previous concepts to you that are still unclear. , ,On culture , ,Flatiron wants you to overcommunicate. You will suffer if you don't speak up or fail to let your tablemates know you don't follow. People here are ready to help. At least your cohort. Nobody's competing with anyone either. They make that very clear from the very beginning., ,So 'in-person web dev' wise, I'm happy. I love the culture, I love the intensity and as long as you keep absorbing like a sponge, you'll be fine., ,On Placement, ,Flatiron's Career Placement team actively finds opportunities for you. Your career coaches help you package your story the best way possible to make sure you are ready for the non-technical aspects of your interviews. 
4/19/2017, • Graduate , •  Course: iOS Development Immersive , •  Campus: New York City ,Verified via GitHub,[object Object],[object Object],I attended Flatiron School's iOS Immersive program in the fall of 2016. I absolutely LOVED it! I learned so much from the course; the instructors were unbelievably helpful and approachable and the material was both challenging and instructive. The career team was very helpful in preparing me for interviews and in managing the process of finding a job. Strongly recommend this course! 
4/8/2017, • Software Engineer , • Graduate , •  Course: Online Web Developer Program , •  Campus: Online ,Verified via GitHub,[object Object],[object Object],This place, this thing, the Flatiron School gave me what I thought it should, an education in a full stack of programming languages so I can build stuff. But that doesn't even scratch the surface. Honestly. I knew I wanted to learn to code after having a little exposure to it. Sure, there is a stigma around it (love it or hate it) that tech is the future and its a necessary skillset that makes you an employable cog in a wheel if you can write code. But what about liking what you do? What about being creative? What if you could have a skill that you can tie into virtually any other industry? I learned at Flatiron how to take who I am and wrap it in code. I let it make me into the person I was meant to be professionally and that's driven, intuitive, and passionate. The difference between Flatiron and other educational options out there is the culture. They didn't just teach us, they incubated us. The teaching staff, the career coaches, and the guys who started the place (especially the guys who started the place) showed us how to love code and somehow gave us the exact right tools in the exact right order to help us help ourselves. So now I'm a powerhouse. No joke. I funded a startup and I'm also working writing code at a mogul in the financial industry. This is thanks to Avi, Adam, Joe, Mollie, Luke, Mendel, and my classmates. ,I don't just have an education now. I have a career, a people, and my best self. Needless to say, I recommend it to anyone with even a drop of desire to improve themselves. 
4/3/2017, • Student , •  Course: iOS Development Immersive , •  Campus: New York City ,Verified via GitHub,[object Object],[object Object],Allow me to start with the opportunities: it took me longer than I originally expected to secure a position and I didn't expect to move when I was originally applying for the program.,I graduated from Flatiron School's iOS Development Immersive on August 26th, 2016. Prior to Flatiron, I mainly held various retail roles (ranging from entry level to leadership) & a strong passion for creating music. My introduction to coding was through Flatiron School's assigned pre-work (which is free and available to anyone prior to enrolling, becomes required once accepted). ,The instructors are very helpful and give you different perspectives on how to debug your code. If you expect the instructors to come over and give you the solution to your problem, you will be disappointed. They are there to push you in the right direction, it's important that you work through these issues on your own. Programming is the hardest thing I've ever picked up, but it's also the most rewarding once things start clicking and you stick with it! The instructors give lectures, are available for questions regarding labs & conduct assessments to gauge how well the students are picking up the content.,Flatiron's career services team may very well be the best part. I only say this because I believe you can get a similar education at a DevBootcamp or GeneralAssembly (minus the innovative Learn platform), but their business team is unparalleled. The immediate week after graduation, a "campus draft" (I believe this is called something different now) is conducted where the Career Services team partners students with employers who have openings in either intern or junior roles. You can tell there's a real effort to match students with companies that are a culture fit, which saves everyone time. Two of my classmates were hired out of campus draft.,I accepted a position as an Associate iOS Engineer at URBN (parent company of Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie & Free People) & decided to relocate to Philadelphia from NYC. I was put in touch with this company through Flatiron back in October & after a long, rigerous interview process, accepted an offer a few weeks ago. On top of it all, I met an amazing group of friends at Flatiron. I now have an incredible network of classmates who work for companies such as Intel, BuzzFeed, LinkedIn & MapBox to name a few!,If you take the bootcamp seriously as well as their career advice, you will secure employment. In the end, it is a very self driven program. With that said, I wouldn't have even known where to drive & Flatiron gave me that direction. I'm forever grateful & would highly recommend Flatiron School!
3/29/2017, • iOS Developer , • Graduate , •  Course: iOS Development Immersive , •  Campus: New York City ,Verified via LinkedIn,[object Object],[object Object],The review below is in reference to the iOS program. Many of the pros and cons are not applicable to the Web immersive :),Pros: I was almost unable, and completely intimidated by code when I came into Flatiron. I had been attempting to learn iOS programming(objective-c) on my own, but it was slow to the point of just not happening. Flatiron managed to make a curriculum that was digestible for my learning style, which revolves around hands on experience.  I came out knowing how to make applications well enough to work on my own and get better, although I would say I was not completely job ready.  ,If you do your best on all the coursework and the extra challenges on each unit, you will come out knowing how to make things.  If you do that AND do work outside of the classroom developing applications or studying comp sci/best practices/other programming languages, then you will probably be truly hireable immediately.  ,Cons:  Flatiron's courses are only 3 to 4 months(4 if you are on one of the NYC scholarship programs).  This means they have to cram as much as they can about iOS development in during that time and some major things go missing.,It results in students having no knowledge of architecture practices, design patterns, etc. While it would be lovely if employers were willing to take Junior developers on knowing that they can learn these things, that is just not how the current iOS market is, and it can make it hard to get a job.  I understand that the motivation for not including these things is because they feel like they literally can not fit it in the timeline that they have, and that makes sense. But, that means they either have to change their job placement promises, extend the programs, or provide extra resources for learning outside of class, because it absolutely affects initial hireability.,I also think that they could create extra curriculum for the students who think they could complete it, or even just a study guide. Architecture, Design Patterns, suggested languages, Comp sci fundamental topics.  Just to give students who are comfortable the option so that they can be doing it outside of class for four months instead of in a mad rush two weeks before an interview.,Summary:,If you also do work outside of class and study and practice all of the things mentioned above, you will absolutely be 100% hireable. I got a job within three months and have been working professionally since.,Flatiron changed my life. It changed the way I think and the way I learn. I wouldn't have the career I love without it.  I recommend it to my friends and have referenced them knowing full well Flatiron will give them the tools they need to be successful.
3/17/2017, • Web Developer , • Graduate , •  Course: Online Web Developer Program , •  Campus: Online ,Verified via GitHub,[object Object],[object Object],tl;dr:,The Long Story,For the past year or 18 months, I'd been teaching myself to code, but it was a really unfocused effort.  I did a million tutorials.  I took a few edX courses.  But I didn't really feel like I was making a lot of forward progress.  I started researching bootcamps.  I live in the Austin, TX area and there are actually quite a few in-person bootcamps, but they've all got a hefty price tag - well north of $10k.  I quickly ruled that out.  I started reading about online bootcamps, and to be perfectly honest, they seemed like a little too good to be true.  Looking back, I think it was the combination of desperation and motivation which made me even consider it in the first place.  I liked that Flatiron offered a 'monthly subscription' payment model, which would further encourage me to crank through the coursework.  I'd recently received my tax return and had some meager savings, so I needed to plow through the material and get a job ASAP.  I quit my job and enrolled.  A 'sink or swim' or 'do or die' type of situation might not appeal to you, but it was what I needed.,I think this past programming knowlege  was the fulcrum, with Flatiron the lever which allowed me to succeed.  I couldn't have done it with only one half of that equation.  Over the course of months, I witnessed many, many students just failing to comprehend a lot of the concepts in the course.  I think it might be disengenuous to imply that in only 12 weeks, a person can go from only a casual experience in writing code to a person who is hireable; even as a 'junior developer.'  If you have very little or no software development experience and you're considering a coding bootcamp, I'd encourage you to spend a good amount of time doing independent study beforehand.  Remember, Flatiron advertises some pretty impressive job placement rates, but that definitely is predicated upon you actually finishing the course.  I would estimate that the washout rate is quite high.  Additionally, take a close look at the terms of service: Your work is far, FAR from done once you graduate. ,After completing the coursework, I hustled a little and got a couple part-time/contract gigs, one of which *REALLY* saved me from putting in an application at Best Buy or The Home Depot.  I owe a *lot* to that employer; it wasn't the best arrangement, by far, but it allowed me to keep my head above water.  If you're considering quitting your job to do a coding bootcamp, make absolutely sure you can foot the bill:  I'd try to plan to have 3-6 months of expenses *after* you complete the program.  Engaging in a full-scale job hunt while at the same time working a lousy retail job doesn't sound like my cup of tea, and that doesn't take into account writing blog posts, working on side projects to get your github profile looking attractive, etc.  It's really hard.  If you can do it, I would suggest you see if you can keep your current job or work reduced hours while you work through the course.,I think that the main benefit of the curriculum, at least for me, was that it provided me a good roadmap for the knowledge I needed to follow.  First procedural Ruby, then SQL (I think), then OOP with Ruby, then Rails, then jQuery with Rails, etc.  I really felt carried along in my learning.  That is, like I said, until the later part of the course.  I swear, I'm done with Angular 1.x, like, for life.,Student Support,I do wish there were more opportunities for code review.  I had three or four, I believe, and only one of them was really in-depth.  Maybe it was because I was clearly 'getting it' and didn't need advice, but I know that my code style was pretty naive and I could've used more direction in that regard.  Plus, as you get further into the program, a lot of issues are not really suited for an 'ask a question' sort of venue.  If you're having difficulty understanding asynchronous javascript, what you really need is for someone to sit down with you for 20 minutes and work it all out with you.  The tutors are all answering a handful of questions at once, jumping back and forth from you to any number of other students.  It can make what would be a simple exchange a pretty drawn-out process.,Wrapping Up
3/12/2017, • Student , •  Course: Online Web Developer Program , •  Campus: Online ,Verified via GitHub,[object Object],[object Object],I've been enrolled in online full stack developer program. I've been a super advocate of the program to anyone I know who wants to make a transition. ,I've personally been doing some dev stuff for many years but never got a proper education. I love the way the online program is taught, the flow completely makes sense. I've even learned new things within topics I thought I knew. It's given me a lot of confidence.,The program will definitely require you to commit. It's not easy everyday. But the online community make that easier. When you're having a bad day where nothing makes sense, you can aways reach out to them or the teachers. ,I'm not even out of the program yet that I've already gotten job offers. Seriously, the best. I've tried Udacity, Codecademy, and other platforms before. But this, to me, is truly the best.  
2/9/2017, • Junior iOS Developer , • Graduate , •  Course: iOS Development Immersive , •  Campus: New York City ,Verified via GitHub,[object Object],[object Object],Flatiron School is the way modern education and job retraining should be done.,Let me preface my review with a little background on myself:,Okay, that out of the way:,Flatiron School is a fantastic educational experience. They truly give you the tools you need to become a working engineer in the real world, which is a welcome break for most of us whose college educations have left us with less-than-ideal skillsets in the working world. You aren't going to leave Flatiron as a chef de cuisine, but if you're ready to work you'll be more than qualified as a competant line cook. From there, the opportunities are endless and success is up to you.,I attended the iOS Immersive and less than a month from graduating the program I got a junior dev job with a startup. The job was placed through Flatiron's Career Services team, who are ridiculously dedicated to finding work for graduates. I don't imagine it's an easy gig convincing companies to hire brand new boot camp graduates, so don't expect to be sitting down with Google or Facebook. But if what you're concerned about is making a transition into the field, their team will get you there. I love my new job and am excited about my future as a software engineer. ,Just like anything else, the true value of the experience is in the hands of the student. Going to Flatiron is a serious time investment and potentially watershed decision. But if you're open, curious, and driven, Flatiron provides the tools and the talent to change your life.
2/5/2017, • Graduate , •  Campus: New York City ,Verified via GitHub,[object Object],[object Object],The Flatiron school changed my life. I learned the basics of programming on my own and once I clearly became passionate about it i decided to power up my knowledge and went to the Flatiron School. I think what makes the school so different is that people there are truly passionate about coding and see it as a lifelong craft. I thank all the people I've learned with. ,Learn love code <3
2/2/2017, • Developer , • Graduate , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: New York City ,Verified via GitHub,[object Object],[object Object],I completed the full-stack web development program in the spring of 2016. This program was a great way to learn the fundamental concepts of web development and how to build a full web application from scratch.  The instructors I had were very talented (I still sometimes use one of the TA’s blogs for reference at work) and more importantly- extremely dedicated (I still get advice from them once in a while) . From them, I learned not only technical skills, but also the ability to troubleshoot new problems and learn new programming tools on my own. Their passion for programming was infectious. ,I also loved the fact that the school puts a lot of thought into their educational philosophy. It empowers students with perspective that to achieve greatly, starting and persisting usually lead to success.   The school also does a great job in creating a cooperative environment where students learn from each other instead of competing with each other- which is a lot more akin to how teams that achieve in the workplace function. Finally, I really found a lot of value in the fact that Avi, the school’s dean- a successful entrepreneur himself- takes time to inspire an entrepreneurial spirit that is felt around the school and imbues  the learning process.  
1/30/2017, • Mobile Developer , • Graduate , •  Course: iOS Development Immersive , •  Campus: New York City ,Verified via GitHub,[object Object],[object Object],I graduated from the iOS program in the summer of 2014. I've been working at an awesome mobile agency building iOS apps for a wide range of clients for the past 2 1/2 years. Before applying to Flatiron, I knew that I needed to fully commit to an in-person program if I wanted to become a developer. Learning how to program part-time by yourself is very difficult and there's a tendency to not stick to deadlines. After just over two months at Flatiron, I had what I thought then was a solid grasp of iOS programming fundamentals. There's a huge learning curve in the beginning when you first learn how to program. The teachers distill the most important concepts so you don't get lost in the weeds. The TAs help you when you get stuck, and your classmates are smart individuals who help keep you motivated.,The criticism of bootcamps that they provide a shallow introduction to development is justified. The reality is that Flatiron teaches you just enough to become a productive developer. Where you go from there is up to you. In my first few weeks at work I quickly realized that we had learned just a tiny fraction of what we needed to know to become great developers. At some point you have to really develop a love for tech and programming. There will be a lot of nights and weekends spent solving very difficult problems. Over two years in, I still learn new things everyday and I don't see that changing anytime soon.,I met some great friends at Flatiron and there was always a focus on placing students in programming jobs after graduation. If you're thinking of applying to Flatiron, don't look at it as your ticket to a cooler job and higher pay. That may happen, but I think the most successful students see Flatiron as a launching pad to help get them into a rewarding career. Oddly, you may end up working twice as hard in your new career, but so far I have yet to have a boring day.
1/27/2017, • Software Engineer , • Graduate , •  Course: iOS Development Immersive , •  Campus: New York City ,Verified via LinkedIn,[object Object],[object Object],I can honestly say that the Flatiron School was one of the best professional decisions I've made and is up there as one of the best ways to learn relevant software development techniques--so much so that I'm considering going back and taking the Web Development Intensive.,I made a pretty drastic career shift about 3 years ago. I went from working in magazines to working as a software developer and I can say, without a shadow of a doubt, I wouldn't have been able to make that switch without the Flatiron School. I was not only provided with a large host of relevant topics, but I was also encouraged to put them in practice with the coding challenges, as well as side projects. Furthermore, while you're there, you're surrounded by people in the same boat. Everyone attending the program genuinely wants to learn and that atmosphere is infectious.,And for anyone that might be worried about your age or experience, don't be. It doesn't matter what your software background is, how old you are, etc. I had people 7 years younger than me (I took the course when I was 24) and over 10 years older than me in the class with a variety of experience levels and everyone ended up learning the material and eventually getting a software development job.,All in all, while it wasn't always easy, 
1/26/2017, • Product Manager , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: New York City ,Verified via GitHub,[object Object],[object Object],It was as a Product Manager in SF that I got really intrigued by these magical creatures called developers. They used said magic to build things, seemingly out of nowhere, that real people used to improve their lives, to communicate, to buy stuff. I wanted to be able to create as well,I started my quest to learn programming by completing online tutorials, reading entry-level books, and attending online classes like codecademy. They served as a great starting point but I immediately realized that they wouldn't get me to a level where I'd be able to meaningfully contribute on the job or to build out side projects end-to-end. It was time to take a next step.,That next step was Flatiron School. A 12-week intensive bootcamp, teaching all the fundamentals of full-stack web development AND which gives you the time, mentors, and guidance to actually work on, complete, and deploy real-life applications. The reason it worked for me was that a) it presented me with a more formal and guided curriculum which you have to cobble together yourself otherwise, b) it forced me to learn the basics (of programming languages, databases, version control, etc) as opposed to simply following steps in a tutorial on how to build a to-do app using the latest and shiniest framework, c) it was an awesome environment to learn, in the sense that you get "unstuck" immediately by virtue of your peers and teachers, which is not the case if you're learning on your own, and finally d) it instilled a passion for software development that I'll leverage for the rest of my life. It's only when you enjoy it, that you'll actually keep learning. Flatiron School managed to light that fire for me, through passionate teaching.,All-in-all I'm a very happy bootcamp grad. I went back to Product Management, but I'm better equipped to do my job. And I started an e-commermce side project (www.stadsmus.be) all by myself, which I would never have been able to do if it weren't for Flatiron School. In short, I would advise anyone with an itch to learn coding to take this route.
