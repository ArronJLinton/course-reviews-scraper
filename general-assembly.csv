8/20/2017, • Graduate , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: Sydney ,Verified via LinkedIn,[object Object],[object Object],I enrolled in the WDI of GA because I wanted to learn how to create websites. In the 3 months I was with them, the instructor taught us everything we needed to know and more. GA does a spectacular job of providing support to its students and creating a fun and lively ambience for students to learn. I highly recommend the course to anyone who wants to learn web development.
8/17/2017, • Graduate , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: Sydney ,Verified via LinkedIn,[object Object],[object Object],The course is very well structured and challenging. GA have the best instructors and the best supporting staff, they make the learning experience so much fun. I learned so much in such a short period of time, and I enjoyed every moment of the course.
8/10/2017, • National eCommunications Manager , • Graduate , •  Course: User Experience Design (Part-time) , •  Campus: Sydney ,Verified via LinkedIn,[object Object],[object Object],I've worked in the digital industry for 15 years but was feeling a bit flat. I finally had the headspace (after having 2 kids) to start thinking about my career again and wanted to fill in the gaps and get up to speed. ,That was my intention... but what happened exceeded expectations. ,I had used the 'tools of the trade' before, and had even freelanced as a UX designer. But this course gave me a better understanding of the WHY, and HOW to turn all the bits of information into actionable insights and using that to inform the design process. ,It was challenging and empowering to break old habits and to focus so much energy on making sure you are solving the 'right' problem before allowing yourself to move into solution mode. Seeing classmates go through their own 'aha' moments was really interesting, as was the breadth of final presentations and hearing all the challenges and pivot moments. We had an extremely supportive group of teachers, teaching aids and classmates. ,Two months on, and I am loving my job. Applying the 'process' of UX to my current work has been immensely satisfying and achieving much better results. Instead of using the 'tools' in an ad hoc manner, I have the confidence to communicate the entire process as part of risk management and get more engagement from stakeholders. Instead of being reactive when somebody tells me they need a solution that does XYZ, I can use the UX language to find out more about the 'suspected problem' so we can move through the various stages to make sure we are solving the right problem before we even start thinking about the solution. ,I could go on and on. 
7/22/2017, • Product Manager , • Graduate , •  Course: Product Management Immersive , •  Campus: Sydney ,Verified via LinkedIn,[object Object],[object Object],A well run course, pitched primarily at the entry level for Digital Product Managers.  The presenter did a great job of presenting the key principles in a fresh and lively manner and illustrated many key points with some real world examples.  The class members were energetic, fun and made solid contributions to learning for everyone.  Final, group project added an extra dimension to learning and it was practical and fun.  A great way for me to get a refresh on some key Product Management principles and upskill on more digitally focussed areas. 
6/6/2017, • Software Engineer , • Graduate , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: New York City ,Verified via GitHub,[object Object],[object Object],I took WDI from March to June of 2015. I previously had a job in community relations, but felt uninspired by my day-to-day (I just hated it). I tried out some free resources on Codecademy and applied to several bootcamps. After checking a few out, I liked the campus and curriculum at General Assembly the best.,About two years later - no regrets. I love programming, and GA gave me what I needed to do this as a career! My teachers were fantastic, passionate, and gifted with coding and educational chops. It was VERY stressful at times, but I loved working together with my classmates to get to "the next level," so to speak.,My only note is that I had a job lined up before graduation, so I don't have experience with the career coaching so much.

3/12/2017, • Online marketing manager , • Graduate , •  Course: Data Analytics (Part-time) , •  Campus: London ,Verified via LinkedIn,[object Object],[object Object],I took the Data Analytics part-time course in London. The program consists of learning the process of data analysis and practical skills to perform data analysis., ,Nowadays for online business, marketing & data analysis tend to become a one-person job as campaigns can be optimised in real time based on their performances. This program gives you a set of skills that aren't taught at the university if you studied broad subjects like marketing or business.,The theoretical part was very useful for me to understand what is the best approach before to do a specific analysis. How to prepare the business questions and choose a data set.,Then we did many exercises using Excel, SQL, Tableau to learn how to leverage those tools to make the analysis and provide great data insights.,What makes me satisfied is that I could use at work the next day what I had learned at night. ,I also met interesting, passionate and motivated people. In my group there was people from many industries (Finance, online business, offline business ...)., 
3/3/2017, • Director, Knowledge Management , • Graduate , •  Course: Product Management Immersive , •  Campus: San Francisco ,Verified via LinkedIn,[object Object],[object Object],Great Product Management course for a med device product manager. Learned enough to understand how I could improve my job today and where I could keep improving.
1/5/2017, • Digital Marketing Analyst , • Graduate , •  Course: Data Science (Part-time) , •  Campus: Sydney ,Verified via GitHub,[object Object],[object Object],The Data Science course at GA was excellent!,As anyone who has any prior knowlege of the field would expect, the curriculium is quite broad, and as a result the part-time course does not go in depth in any areas, but rather takes you through the basics in as many areas as it can in 10 weeks. I imagine the full-time course would provide a more conclusive education, but i can't really comment on that.,Even though I would not recommend the part-time course to people looking for a conclusive education, it was invaluable to me and will be to people looking to explore the options available in the Data Science profession. The part-time course does not pretend to give you all the tools you need to succeed in the industry. Instead, GA has clearly realised that would be cramming too much into too little time, and have structured the course to give you a good introduction to each area of Data Science and provide you with enough information to get you started on your own educational journey.,This course will provide you with the basic knowlege of tools, concepts and processes needed to get started with your own exploration and an excellent environment to ask questions and network with like-minded professionals.,I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in getting started in Data Science, but doesn't know where to start and what's involved.
8/20/2017, • Student , •  Course: User Experience Design Immersive , •  Campus: London ,[object Object],[object Object],I am a graduate of the User Experience Design Immersive Course in London from May-July 2017. I originally was on the February 2017 intake but had to pull out in Week 3 due to a sudden illness. While I was recovering in hospital they could not have treated me any better and offered me whatever options I wanted to take. I then re-started the course in May when I had recovered and am now in the job search phase of it. So far the job support has been quality and you are going to get out of it what you put in - but it's important to note that the support is there. The course itself is fast-paced, full on and requires your 100% commitment - and I wouldn't want it any other way. We had an experienced senior UX Designer as our teacher, and if we had any feedback we were constantly encouraged to speak up. It was a positive learning environment, (but it did help that we had a classroom full of students that handled the pressure cooker well). If you are unsure about General Assembly - they are top notch and are worth the investment. But if you are deciding on a career change like I did, make sure you go to the many free open nights and speak to the team there to see if it's right for you. And if it is - go for it!
8/10/2017, • Data Analyst , • Graduate , •  Course: Data Science Immersive , •  Campus: Washington ,[object Object],[object Object],General Assembly was a great experience for me, and I would recommend it whole-heartedly. But you need to know what you're in for before you sign up. It's like a language immersion, but for data. The data science immersive was very challenging because they're teaching you a ton of stuff in a very short amount of time. To get the most out of it, you will be getting 8-hours of in-class instruction each day, and should expect an additional 3-hours of homework after that to solidify the material you learned. Each day, you learn two important topics related to data science (one in the morning, and another in the afternoon). They don't really repeat things if you don't quite get it, so you have to pay attention, you have to do your homework, and you have to not sweat the fact that you probably won't leave the course a total master at everything. If you come into the course with a bit of python as background, that will help you immensely. If you do the work, you will come out of the class with a solid data science foundation. You should know though that completing the course alone will not get you a job. You need to actually have the skills at the end, as employers will test your abilities during the application process. You can't fake knowing data science. For this reason, the job coaches can only get you so far. Think of this less as something you "buy" or "get" and more of something you "do" or "work for" and you should be able to get a lot from the class. If you don't have the right attitude, the time, or the discipline to learn the materials, then this course is not for you.
8/9/2017, • Product Designer , • Graduate , •  Course: User Experience Design Immersive , •  Campus: London ,[object Object],[object Object],I move to London for the UXDI Course and it's been one of my best decisions so far. The course was everything I needed and expected. I wanted to shift from Visual Design tu UX Design and GA gave me the skills and knowledge I needed. The 10 weeks are divided into different projects in groups and individualy. You have to work hard but at the same time you enjoy every single second that goes by. The Instructional team was very professional, supportive and engaging all the way through. You meet very creative fun and interesting people that by the end of the course become your 'GA Family', your friends. 
8/9/2017, • Interior Designer  , • Graduate , •  Course: User Experience Design (Part-time) , •  Campus: Sydney ,[object Object],[object Object],I studied the UX part-time course (2 nights a wk). Loved every minute I was there. It is faced pace and very informative. I learnt more in 10 weeks of this course than I did in some semesters at University. Really loved the staff, all very eager to help in any way they can. I was very sad it was over at the end of the 10 weeks. 
8/7/2017, • Student , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: Los Angeles ,[object Object],[object Object],This place is a joke...they rob you of your money and run!!  I took the wdi course and it was a waste of money and time.  Do not go here, they will teach you nothing!!  if you struggle, all  they do is push you aside, instead of helping you figure out why you are.  The student services and outcome sucks too!! Lisa is not a good person and very rude!! as well as her coworker Michelle,  they are too self-involved with their reputation then trying to help you out.  Do not fall into their scam....it is a waste of money.  they will tell you to quit your job to take the program and when you struggle they will try and convince you to drop the class.  They don't care about you, only about your money!!!
8/3/2017, •  Course: Digital Marketing (Part-time) , •  Campus: Sydney ,[object Object],[object Object],The content was relevent, prepared in advance and presented in a simple, easy to read way. The teachers were extremely knowledgable in their area of expertise and no question was a silly question. Not only were the teachers available during the course of the day but were happy to stay back after class each day to answer any questions.,Coming in from a low level degree of knowledge in digital marketing, I feel like I learned quite a bit and it's given me motivation to explore it and apply it to my career.
8/2/2017, • UX Designer , • Graduate , •  Course: User Experience Design Immersive , •  Campus: London ,[object Object],[object Object],I took the UXDI course in London early last year. My background had nothing to do with it, I was working in a warehouse moving boxes here and there and working on weekends.,Right after the course I got hired as a Teaching Assistant at GA London for the next UXDI, which was an amazing experience, and nicely paid, which was great because I was broke :),I finished teaching on a Friday. The next Tuesday I started my first UX job at an agency in London. Now I just got offered another job, with a great pay rise and better conditions. I went from 23K to 40K in year and a half. Pretty sweet. And no more lifting heavy boxes or working weekends.,One thing though: The course is just the beginning, you need to work hard during and after the course. Read books, go to meet ups, roll in courses, online and offline, keep learning. GA can teach you the way, but you have to walk it.
8/1/2017, • Web Developer , • Graduate , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: London ,[object Object],[object Object],General Assmbly was amazing. I went in knowing a bit a bit HTML and CSS having tried to teach myself for a few months so found the first week pretty straight forward. After that, it was incredibly full on and we got stuck in with the more difficult concepts of web development. 
8/1/2017, • Developer , • Graduate , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: London ,[object Object],[object Object],Hand on my heart, I would recommend(with bright lovely colours)WDI to anyone who asks me. ,Environment,The London campus is full of support, laughter, and fantastic vibes, all of which mix very well for a perfect 12 week course. The front of house staff are exceptional, and they maintain the campus to the highest standard. London hold superb events to which I have made a great deal of fantastic contacts from. The campus is in the heart of Aldgate and is surrounded by yummy food places and cheeky 'drink' places to kick back in. ,Instructors/ Staff,The instuctors at GA are on another level. Their complete expertese, patience and support really help you feel like you can smash the course (with hard work). They are not only supportive, but they are honest too if you're not pulling your weight during the course which for me, is vital. The outcomes team who help you through the course with your job search are outstanding. They go above and beyond to help you find that first job after the course. The patience they have for each and every student is one of the reasons I would reccomend the course and the London campus. ,Curriculum,GA's curriculum was a part of the course I was completely blown away with. We were all told from day one that the course would be full on and that basically you wouldn't have a life but the way they structured the course was perfect. I understand now that the WDI course will be moving to React as part of the curriculum which for me is the absoloute right direction. ,Overview,Overall I would give GA 9 out of 10. Anyone who is looking to step into the exciting pond of development would be utterly over the moon with this course. Putting the price of the course aside, this for me was a complete investment. ,So much love for GA 
7/19/2017, • Graduate , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: London ,[object Object],[object Object],A friend recommended this course and found it really great. However, there were only 16 people in their class - there were 30 in mine. I felt sorry for the tutors having to deal with a large group of students with such a diverse range of skill and needs - They were actually quite good, but getting their attention was difficult. The pace of the classes was greatly affected by the wide range of skill levels and the number of students. With regards to our projects, there were a few times where tutors would take over and basically do our code.,I felt mislead by this course. Firstly, because the website implies that there's a daily structure - a period of time designated to labs etc. Secondly, that there would be pair programming. We didn't have many opportunities to do any labs and experiment and speaking to graduates from Makers, pair programming really helped them progress and learn.,I would only recommend this course if you have a solid foundation in coding already, or have a STEM background. Before joining I was led to believe that you didn't need much experience and that everything will eventually click into place. 4 months on and I'm still waiting for things to fall into place. I can now see why Founders and Coders are very strict with their entrance requirements - as it pays to be prepared as you can before an intensive 3 months of learning. , 
7/18/2017, • Developer ,[object Object],[object Object],I want to delete this review, but Coursereport doesn't allow it. 
7/6/2017, • Graduate , •  Course: Android Development Immersive , •  Campus: New York City ,[object Object],[object Object],General Assembly was an overall great experience. I came into the course with previous experience programming, particularly with Java, and that was definitely a great help. I feel that the course gave me an excellent, solid foundation with Android fundamentals. I was also able to put together a decent portfolio of projects that I'll be able to continue to develop as I learn new skills.,As far as career assistance goes, General Assembly put me in a good place to help myself get a job. I have a personal portfolio website hosted by github, a complete Linkedin page, and an up to date resume. I also maintain access to the carreer assistance program for as long as I need, so long as I am actively applying for jobs and regularly attending networking events.,I am currently actively looking for jobs, and there are certainly a lot of options in the New York City area. The only issue is that most postings ask for 2+ years of professional development experience, with at least a year of Android development. This is a tough requirement for any recent graduate of a program that teaches a new skill, but can be particularly tough for someone who is switching careers from a non-technical background.,TL;DR: I recommend the program. Previous programming experience is not required, but helps. Career assistance helps you help yourself.
6/30/2017, • Applicant , •  Campus: Melbourne ,[object Object],[object Object],The course is structured and intense - helped me build up my foundations on my digital marketing skills. Loved the class and the people in the class (including the instructors and staff of GA). ,I would highly recommend anyone to join this course to upgrade their skills and refine their knowledge!
6/29/2017, • Student , •  Course: Digital Marketing  (Part-time) , •  Campus: New York City ,[object Object],[object Object],Course iteself was actually well run and provided good information about the grwoing field.  My issues with it are more related to how it is looked upon or treated by the school itself.  It seems too stand aone within the curriculum and unfortunately the course and the students seem to be treaetd as the cliched red headed step children of General Assembly. ,After finishing the course it felt like I was just providing tuition to the school and thats all they cared about.,Just my thoughts. Thanks anyway.
6/28/2017, • Graduate , •  Campus: Sydney ,[object Object],[object Object],The most rewarding (and challenging) 12 weeks of my life. The curriculum and my instructors were amazing and helped me gain the skills and confidence that I needed to bring my ideas to life through code. I have met so many incredible people and I am so happy that I have finally made the transition and become a web developer. 
6/17/2017, • Graduate , •  Course: Product Management Immersive , •  Campus: Los Angeles ,[object Object],[object Object],I really enjoyed this class. It is definitely intense and a lot of info to pack into one week but if you need to learn these skills quick I would highly recomend it. The teacher, Suzanne, is great and goes into depth on many of the topics. I feel more confiendent to position myself as a Product Manager as I progress in my career. We did a lot of activities to really put into practice what we were learning. This is intnese though, make sure you are aware of that before committing, you have to dedicate you week to this to get as much as you can out of it.
