7/11/2017, • Software Engineer  , • Graduate , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: Austin ,Verified via LinkedIn,[object Object],[object Object],Background: Retail customer service and sales in the tech/electronic industry, no prior software experience. Some general education teaching experience. ,Now: Just hit 4 months in as a software engineer for a ed-tech company that services students around the world. , ,My review could just be those two lines up there and it would speak for itself but that would be an injustice to both Galvanize as a school and it's staff. From the admissions staff to the career services director, everyone there is working constantly to see you, the student, suceed. I went in interested in learning software development and hoping for a career change, I left with those hopes fulfilled and an insatiable drive in continuing my education as both an evolving engineer and a possible instructor in the future. ,Of course all of that is a side to the meat and potatoes of the main curriculum, so no review would be complete without mention of the instructors. I wish I could look you, the reader, in the eye as I say this; despite it's clichéd nature: I've never had a better teacher than I had while I attended the Austin Galvanize location. Zubair Desai is the instructor you should look for and the teacher I aspire to be. Having some teaching experience I know how difficult the concept and act of teaching.....anything really... to anyone is, it might honestly be the hardest damn thing to do. Bar none. Zubair handles it effortlessly. It's honestly almost wizardry at how much he knows but more than that, how much he can impart on another human being. ,He can take a classroom from nothing and turn them into accomplished software engineers. Period. Every single person in my cohort is working in the programming field as I write this, a literal 100% sucess rate for my class. It's insane. I hope that I can get this across in words as vehemently as I would if I were in front of you, he doesn't just teach you how to learn Javascript or Rails or Java or sorting algorithms or any of a million other things, (Spolier Alert: he does), he teaches you HOW to learn these things. If that doesn't make sense I implore you to enroll and see how you go from knowing nothing as an aspiring developer to being able to teach yourself an entirely unfamiliar language WHILE learning the languages and frameworks that make up the Galvanize curriculum. He's a credit not only to the tech community, in shaping the developers of tomorrow, but a credit to teaching as a profession. Learning from him is a means of unlocking your full potential as a software engineer and I honestly don't know to give higher praise than that. ,During my time there we had the pleasure and privlege of workng with a pair of assistant instructors as well, Oli and Louis; that brought invaluable skills, experience, and humor to the class. From learning the intricacies of Ruby on Rails with Oli to the finer workings of Swift with Louis, ALL of the instructors at Galvanize put the time and effort in making sure you succeed. If you have questions, they're there to make sure you have answers. ,Every moment of my time at Galvanize was spent learning something. It was frustrating at times and blissful the rest but every moment made me the developer I am today and I have this school to thank. For those on the fence, do it, you won't regret it. 
6/24/2017, • Graduate , •  Course: Data Science Immersive , •  Campus: Austin ,Verified via GitHub,[object Object],[object Object],Galvanize offers a complete overview of data science theory and application. The program is very intense but the instructors are amazing at breaking down core concepts into coding building blocks that explain fundamental mathematical underpinnings as well as how to implement in a range of examples. The acceptance rate is pretty low, because the application process is strict, but this maintains a high class standard and ensures quality students will help each other effectively. Career services are top notch and really help career transitions from other industries to effectively stand out. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Galvanize.  
6/23/2017, • Student , •  Course: Data Science Immersive , •  Campus: Austin ,Verified via LinkedIn,[object Object],[object Object],I attended the Galvanize Data Science Immersive in Austin, Texas. Unlike many of the other students, this was actually my second bootcamp, the first being Hack Reactor. ,If you are the type of person who loves learning and is interested in Machine Learning, Galvanize is by far the best place to learn it. The instructors are fantastic, and their curriculum is well structured. , 
3/23/2017, • n/a , • Student , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: San Francisco ,Verified via GitHub,[object Object],[object Object],First off, I'll start this review by telling you all that I didn't end up graduating from the SF Galvanize bootcamp (the only one out of 13. I'll also state that I graduated UCSC with honors, so it's not like I'm completely dumb). Despite my own personal situation (more on this later), I share many similar sentiments with the rest of the cohort about the school.,Secondly, I'm trying to leave a fair review despite not graduating; however, this review is subjective and, of course, is based off my personal experiences at Galvanize. ,A typical day unfolded like this:,9-10: warm-up algorithm,There are 4 quarters at G:,1) Front end (HTML/JS - lots of working with dom manipulation),Each quarter had its own project:,I guess I'll start with the pros of Galvanize:,1) Our personal cohort had an student:instructor ratio of about 13:3 (more on this later), which is a very good ratio as far as bootcamps go (from what I've heard).  Also, the instructors stayed from about 9-6, so we had them for almost a full 8 hours. ,Ok, a lot of good stuff, but there was definitely a lot that could be improved upon (the bad):,1) Of the three instructors, one was really not fit to be an instructor at all. His lecturing skills were bad, and we're all convinced he actually didn't know anything he was talking about. However, it sounds like he's changed his ways since we left, as we did quite a bit of complaining about it.,Not sure if this is relevant or not, but I'll list it anyways as just something to ponder. The prices people paid to get in were kinda all over the place. Like I said, a few of us got 2-4k off, one person got their entire tuition paid for (I think by some foundation, so that may be irrelevant), and one student got half the tuition off upon threatening to go to another bootcamp. Now, from what I understand, there were no scholarships given for the current cohort. ,My personal conclusion:,Galvanize wasn't worth it. Or any other bootcamp for that matter - unless you already have a previous related background and you know your brain is trained to think like a programmer. The market (at least in Silicon Valley) does not want entry level programmers. The risk of not getting a job is too great (unless you plan on moving out of state), especially if you're planning to take out a loan, like I did (and now feel pretty screwed in my situation). ,My personal recommendations:,Do your research. I thought I did enough, but now I don't feel as though I did. I'm not talking about research on just bootcamps, but research on the market, what stacks are most wanted, what camps teach these stacks, and which camps will give you the most support. Research tuition prices, potential scholarships and deals, connections the school might have in terms of job placement, etc. Possibly most importantly, talk to previous grads to get their experiences. Was it worth it for them? Pros? Cons?,Finally, do plenty of soul searching before you fork over thousands of dollars. Do you even want to be a programmer, or are you in it for the money? If you're in it for the money, you might not survive. I personally was in it half way for this reason. Yes, I wanted better pay (how else can one afford a living in Ca? If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Also I had back surgery, so I lost half my job opportunities right there). However, I also knew that I liked solving problems and making things work (better). I also wanted to upgrade my resume. In this sense, it's possible I might not even end up as a developer, but I may end up utilizing my full stack skills in some other way. Combining them with previous work experience? Possible. ,If you don't know if you want to program - take online courses first. Make sure you do enough - not just a few free ones off CodeAcademy. Take full stack courses off Udemy or Udacity, places like that. Even if you spend a couple hundred bucks on online classes, this move can potentially save you thousands of dollars if it turns out you don't wanna program. It's even possible you'll get a job with just online courses if you're that adept. ,Finally, trust your gut. I was very hesitant to fork over the 2,000 tuition fee; I should have taken this as a sign. Throught the first quarter, there were many times when my gut was telling me to drop out. I should have trusted my gut again, yet I listened to instructors that told me I should stick with it.,Remember, my experience at G was subjective (as everyone else's). Read more than just my review. Do your research and soul search!,Good luck in your bootcamp prospects!
3/10/2017, • Cognitive Apps Engineer , • Graduate , •  Course: Data Science Immersive , •  Campus: San Francisco ,Verified via LinkedIn,[object Object],[object Object],Hi Everyone, ,Greetings!,The perspective I am sharing is that of an individual who moved to SF just to join the program, from another country.,I moved here from the Philippines in September, three days before the start of Week 0, the "intro" to the "intro to Python" (I highly recommend it). I chose Galvanize because as early as 2013, I was already aware of Data Science and Zipfian, and read so many good things about the program. Because of life circumstances, I could only join after June 2016. This April 2017, I am just about to start my career in Tech at IBM - working on Data Science and Artificial Intelligence projects. I can honestly say that none of this would be possible if not for my experience at Galvanize.,I have two main points for this review that I am writing:,1. The Galvanize Data Science Immersive Program is transformative - there are so many things today that I could not have done in Sep 2016, and I largely attribute these to my phenomenal growth rate as a result of the instructors and curriculum,Point 1: The Galvanize Experience,Point 2: What You Get Depends On You,My Galvanize experience was great. Partly because of Galvanize, and partly because I made the most out of it. I highly recommend this program to anyone - but just make to understand that it is not going to be a walk in the park. To get the most out of it, you have to work very hard.,Cheers, ,Brian
3/1/2017, • Graduate , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: San Francisco ,Verified via GitHub,[object Object],[object Object],Galvanize is a great community to be a part of. I took the 8wk night class on Javascript first and it really helped me prepare for the bootcamp, I highly recommend it, especially since they reimburse you for it if you end up taking the 6 month program. I learned more than I knew was possible in 6 months there. There is so much support, instruction, exercises. There are also a lot of events at galvanize so you can network and get some food when you need a break from studying. They have career services to help you on the job search. One thing I really enjoyed here was the third quarter on data structures and algorithms, it was interesting and useful!
7/22/2017, • Student , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: Phoenix ,[object Object],[object Object],This review is from my perspective of having just completed just the first quarter of this 6 month course, but I wanted to put this review out immediately because just a few weeks ago there were no firsthand accounts of the brand new phoenix branch. I will update/alter this review as the course progresses at least one more time. I came into the course knowing no one, with a fair bit of skepticism, but being highly optimistic about making a lot of progress in little time. After 6 weeks I have found that whatever doubts I had before starting to be unfounded. The group of instructors, faculty, admin, and other students that currently exist is phenomenal - the curriculum seems to be the right balance of being well-structured and flexible to capitalize on trends and opportunities. It also balances breadth with depth. Fundemental/current technologies with the new and shiny ones. Galvanize consistently holds events that are great for networking (and with awesome catering/beverages ;) and are a lot of fun. The first cohort of students from this program is now graduating and seem to be in a good position to find a job if they don't have one already. There's lots of training and coaching for the job search that graduates will face. I've been amazed at how quickly I have evolved from being stuck in console.log land while slogging through basic JavaScript by myself to having a level of skill designing web apps that let me express my ideas and design logic/functionality in a way that seemed completely inaccessible just 6 weeks ago. If youre on the fence, do yourself a favor and chat with the good people here about how you might fit in. It's definitely not for everyone, but if you're willing and able to commit to following this path, Galvanize provides a direct route to get you where you want to go.
7/16/2017, • SoftwareEngineer , • Graduate , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: Seattle ,[object Object],[object Object],Let me start by saying that I've heard similar reviews to this by people from all bootcamps (I spent a month in an internship with ~30 people who came from bootcamps and we swapped stories). Also, I came into the program from a graduate program in STEM and got an internship quickly after - overwhelmingly because of the MS in a STEM field - so these things influence my views.,The top five problems that I found (I am sure I am missing some):,1. Calling it a "bootcamp". Bootcamp implies speed and rigor. This program was easier than a lot of the *single* classes I took in undergrad, not all of the classes I took in a semester, a singular class.,The fourth quarter had that "summer's coming let's chill out vibe" a lot of the time. Frankly I think there was a lot of people giving up on their expectations of a bootcamp by this point. A lot of resignation to the fact that you put a ton of money into something that just didn't deliver a quality education.,Also, Fridays were mostly a waste. There were no lectures on Friday, only a review and "lightening talks". This review consisted of going through the bullet points written into the lectures and writing them on the board while a few sentences were said about that bullet. The lightening talks were supposed to be five minute (always much longer) talks about a tech topic so that people could get used to talking about tech topics in front of a group. Less than a quarter of the lightening talks met those qualifications. The lightening talks were primarily people talking at length about things they were interested in kind of like show and tell, but you're paying $4.2K for it ($21K / 5 days). Almost everyone goofed off after lightening talks ended at three making it hard to accomplish much of anything on that day. Seriously, that means $4.2K wasted to one-line reviews and people gushing about something completely off-topic.,2. The instructor situation was chaotic.,There were four instructors. One was supposed to have been in the field for a long time (the primary instructor). Two were supposed to have been in the field at any point ever (including small contract projects). One was a student from the cohort before.,The first primary instructor we had really didn't know a) how to instruct and b) javascript in a meaningful way. There were warnings from the students in the cohort before ours (who he did a practice lecture with) and from the instructor himself *not to hire this guy*, but they did anyway. It went so badly that they fired him before the first quarter was over.,THEN they took one of the few instructors from the other cohort and made him into our cohort's primary instructor, leaving the other cohort with only one instructor (the other two instructors having gotten jobs/left). The instructor that came to us had just started an MS program, so he was really busy already. The one instructor for the other cohort had a serious family emergency soon after the fiasco with us losing our instructor and we had one instructor left between the two cohorts. The really good instructor had to be shared between the two classes leaving him exhausted and us worried about asking too much of him.,Near the end of our cohort the instructor who had the family emergency before left. I don't know the details, but there's definitely a fight between corporate, who seem to be concerned primarily with money, and the instructors, who seem primarily concerned with education. There were mumblings in the hallways were of this clash pretty regularly. At the end of our cohort, our primary instructor left, likely because of the same concerns. This was the last of the really quality instructors I had known at Galvanize.,3. The pedagogy reflected a complete lack of understanding of teaching/learning. I had been in some sort of teaching/TA/tutoring role for the previous eight years. There's a huge difference between instructors that try to improve by studying educational reasearch and those who do it just through experience or through books the latest fad book with zero citations. Galvanize chose to do the later.,They were dogmatic in their use of "Teach Like a Champion" which included such gems as having the students read outloud the lectures to the class. These lectures (which were actually, more often than not, well put together) were written by someone in corporate, occasionally edited by the instructional staff. This often meant that the instructors themselves didn't really see it as important to read through the lectures ahead of time and anticipate what questions might be asked (like any good instructor knows to do). There were a shocking number of times that the instructors (one in particular) didn't know something was in the lecture they were supposed to be teaching or, even worse, would start to give a half-baked-in-the-moment example of what the material meant only to make the situation FAR worse. These were rookie mistakes that every instructor should make once (I definitely did) and then they should be guided to see that they have to plan ahead. That didn't happen here. Up to the last day, there were painful lectures where there was clearly no planning in advance.,(To be fair, there shouldn't have been behavioral problems in a classroom setting of 16 adults.),One student was verbally abusive to the instructors and, occasionally, other students as well as being loud and disruptive during lectures. Rather than dealing with this right away, we went through the first quarter and a half with the instructors walking on eggshells around and giving special attention to this one student, greatly decreasing any question or lecture time for the rest of us. It took most of the student body having to set up a meeting with the main instructor (who was beat for the reasons listed above) for anything to change. To his credit, after that the situation in the classroom became more reasonable. He has amazing interpersonal skills and solved the problem, but he's not around anymore, so don't expect someone to know how to handle a similar situation (not that there should even be this situation in an adult classroom).,5. The numbers aren't trustworthy.,Early on in every bootcamp more people were getting hired because the marketplace wasn't saturated with bootcamp grads like it is becoming more and more every day. The hiring rates are inflated from the first group. In our cohort, we definitely haven't hit the "91%" hiring rate the website is currently claiming, despite having been out for six months. And among those who get hired the majority are hired on short contracts which, despite offering little by way of stability, Galvanize doesn't distinguish from more stable sitatuions (which most people are looking for).,Take note of this line on their website: , ,To be fair, here's a list of the five positives I can think of (once again, I am likely missing some):,2. Galvanize being a longer bootcamp means that you get to go to a lot more networking events during the program. I went to about three a week, on average. The program being six months rather than 14 weeks meant I went to ~70 events rather than ~40, which helped.,3. The career services person pushed me to put what I really wanted to do (work with data) on my resume even though I was nervous I wasn't prepared. Now I have an amazing position doing exactly what I want. (Go Gina!),5. There are a lot of snacks. I gained about ten pounds because I love snacks. ;), ,I can't speak to the experience of job hunting because I was lucky enough to get an internship directly after the program, but I can say that the feedback on why I got that internship points to the idea that the bootcamp was not even a factor in getting it. The impression I get is that I got an opportunity to interview largely because of my MS in a STEM field and that I got the internship because of a combination of having spent the last seven years working through math/science problems generally and having spent the summer before starting Galvanize working through Cracking the Coding Interview specifically (aka - I did well on whiteboarding).
7/11/2017, • Student , •  Course: Data Science Immersive , •  Campus: Austin ,[object Object],[object Object],The three month Data Science Immersion course was a great experience.  While being very demanding I do not think I could have learned more in such a short time.  The instructors where good and really know what they are doing making difficult concepts understandable. Take the interviews seriously and make sure you understand and as much of the pre-course material as possible.  The more comfortable you are starting the easer the work will be and the more you will learn. 
6/25/2017, • Graduate , •  Course: Data Science Immersive , •  Campus: Austin ,[object Object],[object Object],I attended the data science immersive program for three months in 2017. Galvanize has an amazing community feel, and the instructors are great at explaining concepts to 'naive' students. Through the program, students collaborate with one another which really reinforces concepts taught through lectures. Python and statistics are a must for this program, which is why Galvanize puts students through a screening/interview process. I would recommend this program to anyone who has a high desire to learn and transition into an exciting industry. Galvanize has changed my life through a well thought out course.
6/24/2017, • Student , •  Course: Data Science Immersive , •  Campus: Austin ,[object Object],[object Object],After 3 rounds of interview including Python, SQL, Statistics and Machine Learning, I was admitted to the Data Science program in Austin. The syllabus covers a extremely broad topics, not only coding, machine learning algorithm, big-data tools, but also business insight, which was practiced during 4 case studies. I finished 5 online courses related to machine learning, and 3 online courses related to coding before I attended the program. During the program, 30% content are what I already knew, 30% content are familiar to me but I cannot explain the details, and the leftover 40% are what I haven't heard about. The morning and afternoon assignments everyday help students practice the algorithm just learnt, which can enhance the understanding of the algorithm. Btw, the afternnon assignment is finished by a pair of students, providing the chance to practice communication, which is a very important capability a data scientist needs. One of my favorate parts is the review section after all class were finished. Every pair of students were assigned a topic and gave a presentation about 5-10 minutes. Other studens can ask questions, and instructors will help answer questions if needed. It is a very good practice. 
6/23/2017, • Graduate , •  Course: Data Science Immersive , •  Campus: Austin ,[object Object],[object Object],Galvanize DSI - Austin Campus, ,Galvanize completely exceeded my expectations. The instructors at the Austin campus are superior to any college professor that I had during my time studying engineering. ,When comparing bootcamps, I looked at several options. After speaking with some peers who attended other bootcamps, I know that I made the right choice. These include a competing tech bootcamp and also a major university in Austin that offers some bootcamp programs.,One thing that seperates Galvanize is it's selectivity. The admissions process is pretty rigorous and requires a baseline mathematical knowledge, as well as plenty of studying, and the ability to communicate clearly in technical interviews. At no point in the process did I feel that Galvanize was pushy or trying to 'fill seats'. My peers included several PhDs, many engineers, programmers, an actuary, and many other accomplished individuals.,The curriculum is extremely well designed. The learning style is far superior to a typical college schedule, allowing you to 'drink from the firehose' and absorb a massive ammount of information in a short period of time. I believe the bootcamp format will eventually take over formal education due to it's efficiency. The immersive program feels like a year (it's only 3 months), and has greatly accelerated the rate that I am able to pick up new tech skills.,Our instructors were extremely passionate, well qualified, and great to work with. It was not uncommon for them to spend time with students outside of class to attend workshops and programming meetups. ,Throughout the program, students become connected to the local tech industry, through a combination of campus visits, career services efforts, and the variety of events that take place on campus. I have been fortunate to meet a number of hiring managers, tech employees, and entrepreneurs. At the end of the program, I've built a substantial network in the Austin tech arena. ,If you are smart, ambitious, and value a quality education - Galvanize is the top choice. , 
6/23/2017, •  Course: Data Science Immersive , •  Campus: Austin ,[object Object],[object Object],Far and away the best experience in education I've had the pleasure of experience. Thanks to their rigorous interviewing and prep process, every student is brilliant, tenacious, and dedicated to learning more. The instructors are even more so. The environment is collaborative too. We were constantly tapping on each other's shoulders asking for a little help here or there, and never once was anyone annoyed or unhelpful. I can't recommend this more. Whether you're an experienced data analyst or a bright graduate looking to up their skill level, this program is fantastic. I can't recommend this more to anyone looking at upping their skills in data science. 
4/13/2017, • Associate Software Engineer , • Graduate , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: Austin ,[object Object],[object Object],Galvanize web development immersive is for the people who truly want to learn. The instructors go a great job guiding you throught the thick woods and mountainous terrain of web development, and they really know their stuff. But they won't hold your hand. The best way to get the most out of your time there is by keeping up with the curriculum, and finding extra ways on your own to build on what you have learned. Cultivate your own natural curiousity. Galvanize web dev teaches Node.js/JavaScript, but my cohort had several people do projects in Swift, and pretty much everyone used some large framework or library that wasn't part of the curriculum. If you're ready to take the plunge and do a mixture of instruction and self learning, Galvanize is an atmosphere that will enable you to go very far.
3/30/2017, • Graduate , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: Denver ,[object Object],[object Object],I feel Galvanize is more of a complete learning eco-system than a school. Galvanize's primary focus is on learning and building technical skills. In the process howerver, relationships and soft skills are developed as well. From creating projects to giving tech talks to networking with actual businesses in the building, I feel its been a great springboard for preparing me for a job in the tech industry.
3/29/2017, • graduate , • Student , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: San Francisco ,[object Object],[object Object],Terrible experience.  Tyler good.  Rob bad Parker bad.  Instructors not care about students and leave early even if you struggling.  Program poorly designed and almost all students waste of money.  Past cohort try to warn me not to come but I did not listen.  Career service helpful but it difficult to get job when not prepared.  Job statistics seem like lie.  We told by instructor past cohort all have jobs but this not true.  They tell me.  15 person start our cohort and only 10 finish.  Out of 10, I guess 5-7 will get job.  91% seem like lie when you look at this in front of your face.  Not good at all.  
3/18/2017, • Associate Software Engineer , • Graduate , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: Boulder ,[object Object],[object Object],Like most things in life, you get out what you put in and this program is no different. The curriculum, the instructor staff, the projects are all designed to take you as far as you can push yourself to go.,As others have said, I also put in 20-30 hours a week outside of the core classroom time and I'm glad for every bit of it.  I wanted to be successful at this.  I wasn't just looking for a new job, I wanted to recreate myself and start building a career around being an effective sofware developer.,What I appreciate most about the curriculum is that it's more than the typical "here's a standard stack, let's learn it".  I loved being immersed in both back and front end development, but more than that I appreciated also being tossed into unfamiliar environments.  We got very comfortable at being uncomfortable.  Knowing that even if we hadn't learned what we were working with, we had the skills to figure it out.,So when I started my first job as a software engineer and I was put in front of a codebase that was written in both Coffeescript and Typescript (I only knew vanilla javascript), the database was Mongo (where I had only seen Postgres), the front end was Angular 1.2 (where we had learned on 1.6) I still was able to release new functionality to prod on day 3.  ,I appreciate the instructors for not taking it easy on us. They brought their best every day and expected the same from each of us, pushing us to be better and better, knowing that we could.  I'm also glad they never slowed down the pace because in this industry, things move fast and there's really no choice but to keep up.
3/6/2017, • Student , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: Boulder ,[object Object],[object Object],I’ve been immersed in some of the “top” education available for tech since middle school. I struggled to fit into an education system that demanded mastery of a concept, but provided no motivation to master said concept due to lack of application. It also discouraged people who were maybe a little more right-brained or allotted brain power to wondering about the application of learned concepts to projects, etc. Therefore, the standard for succeeding in the tech industry meant fitting a specific, stereotypical brand of “tech nerd”. ,Galvanize was a platform that proved all of this wrong. It is a 6-month intensive boot camp where people from all walks of life come together and enter the tech world by building full-stack web apps. By promoting a collaborative and supportive environment, we all learn together that it is by being open-source as a community that technology really becomes something more. Programming ultimately is just a tool. It isn’t some unattainable skill that only introverted tech prodigies are able to master. ,The people who will thrive in this program are those who embrace this philosophy that knowledge is that much more powerful when it’s open-source and everyone is able to bring something different to the table. If you are someone who is looking to level-up their life, Galvanize is the program for you. All you need is to be thirsty for knowledge and always be learning from those around you. Understand that what you’ll be gaining is a true understanding of the importance of community in tech and the confidence that whatever seemingly “unattainable” skill there is in the stereotypical image of the tech world 
3/3/2017, • Associate Software Engineer , • Graduate , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: Boulder ,[object Object],[object Object],I graduated from a university in 2012 with a bachelors in psychology and no clear career path. After a few years of traveling and exploring graduate school options for psychology, I decided I wanted to take a completely different route. I found a love for coding and spent 2 months researching ways to learn how to be a developer. I compared many different options including 4 year degrees, online schools, teaching myself, and bootcamps style schools. I discovered Galvanize in the spring of 2016 and was accepted into the program beginning that summer.,I cannot say enough good things about my experience at Galvanize. The instruction team consisted of highly knowledgable, experienced, and passionate teachers. The entire education team at Galvanize cared about every students' success. They truly wanted to help us succeed in the course and after. Their career team and curriculum is not only focused on getting you that first job, but setting up your long term career path.,I graduated from the web-imerssive program in mid-January 2017 and was offered a job 2 weeks later. My salary is above the Galvanize graduate average and I am incredibly happy at my job. My work-life balance is amazing and I am learning more everyday. I am so happy I went to Galvanize and highly recommend it to anyone looking to become a developer.
3/2/2017, • Associate Software Developer , • Graduate , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: Boulder ,[object Object],[object Object],I attended the Full-Stack Web Development Immersive at Galvanize-Boulder, and graduated in mid-January.  Prior to Galvanize, I'd spent 4-5 months self-studying with some basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript via online resources.  The onboarding process for my g32 cohort was smooth; we received the pre-course work (about 40 hours' worth) about a month in advance of our August 1 start date.
1/18/2017, • Student , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: Austin ,[object Object],[object Object],Where to begin...,Fast forward six months. I graduate tomorrow, and while I'm excited to go out and get a job (and have already informally been offered two, by the way), leaving Galvanize as a student will definitely be bittersweet. Besides the remarkable cohesion and synergy of my cohort, the technical learning experiences have been the most & fastest I've ever learned in any academic program...ever.,Galvanize's support/career services are also top-notch. Nicole, career services person, has gone out of her way to help me on multiple occasions. She helps with interview and job search advice, books guest speakers, organizes events...the student success person, Jessica, also held a survey with students once per quarter about our overall experience, and the feedback we gave her seemed like near-immediate implementations. I could go on...even the facilities staff at Galvanize is friendly and helpful.,I chose Galvanize because of its six-month plan, knowing I'd need some time to both have a life in the evenings and complete my homework properly, and it's surely been the right decision, as we had the time to go much deeper into concepts than I've heard my friends from other code schools have.,I will say if you’re not willing to commit to the necessary hours of practice and grit, this program may not be for you, as it's not easy to master, nor should it appear as such. I did struggle a bit with concepts at the beginning, but then again, that's probably standard at any level of programming and I never felt unsupported or alone. By the third quarter of the cohort, some kind of new confidence had arrived when I was able to look back at even a few weeks prior and identify the immense amount of knowledge that had soaked in since, and at that point began building with technologies and libraries that had never been explicitly taught to me. Galvanize does publish its intended curriculum, which seems to be equivalent to or more comprehensive than most of the other ATX code schools, but I feel as though I could learn and use any technology out there at this point., 
1/16/2017, • Front End Engineer , • Graduate , •  Course: Web Development Immersive , •  Campus: Seattle ,[object Object],[object Object],Galvanize provides an unparalleled experience. Locating the school inside a tech startup/meetup space creates an immersive experience where students are exposed to hundreds of professionals in the field.The curriculum at Galvanize is outstanding with very up to date information, practices, and opportunities to delve deeply into related material, libraries, or frameworks. Like anything in life, you get out of the experience what you put in. Look at the time with Galvanize as a major investment in your life, and you will receive a steadfast partner in making your dreams a reality. But, do not take this lightly as you are ultimately responsible for building your new life.,The format is a code-along experience where topics are explained in lecture format while you are coding and trying out each concept as it's presented. The instructors constantly check to make sure that people are getting the concepts and tutors assist those who need it with minimal impact on the pace of moving forward. This is not a school where they teach to the lowest common denominator. Those who are struggling will have to spend extra time to catch up but will be given all the assistance they need to do so. At the end of each day, a project is assigned that reinforces the daily code alongs and allows you to truly lock in the material. At the end of each quarter, a project is assigned that builds on the topics of that quarter and all quarters before it. When you leave the program, you have many projects, notes files, and working programs to use as examples for your future career.,I highly recommend the program for anyone who is motivated and willing to make the sacrifices necessary to change their lives.
1/3/2017, • Graduate , •  Course: Data Science Immersive , •  Campus: San Francisco ,[object Object],[object Object],I was part of cohort 13 that graduated on July 2016 in the San Francisco campus.,Galvanize was life changing for me. It was extremely intense, but it transformed my career. My background is in business strategy and entrepreneurship and now I am a data scientist working with AI and deep learning for security in less than a year!,I studied using their guide materials for about 2-3 months before applying and took a few Coursera classes on Machine Learning as an introduction. The selection process to Galvanize was challenging for me due to the lack of programming and stats skills, it consisted of 1 challenge and 2 interviews.,They offered a week 0 before the program started just focusing on Python that was amazing for me! It helped me get ready and feel more confident in programming. The summary of the Data Science Immersive is: the learning curve is very fast, and the difficult level is always the same, meaning that you learn a lot but always feel like you can barely make it and absorb everything. In the end I feel that was the biggest lesson: they thought me how to learn and how to do it fast.,In general, the instructors were great! There is a weekly constant feedback loop and they are extremely responsive. I put as feedback one time that I was struggling with the math because I am a visual learner and two days later our main instructor approached me to understand better and on the following day all lectures were more visual - truly amazing!,What I wish I knew before: I was expecting to find a job easily since data science is so hot and there's a lot of demand. Job hunting is hard. Looking at "95% placement rate in 6 months" sounds easy. Applying to jobs constantly and networking and keep learning for 6 months is very intense. Don't expect magic. But luckily Galvanize also offer us career counseling, they were the best! They coached us individually, and organized career meetups for alumni every week to brush up our skills, practice whiteboarding, coding, interview questions, exchange best strategies, etc. But still, "data science" is a huge broad field. Companies that have data scientist positions open sometimes want an Excel number cruncher, while others need a very specific industry experience, etc. Keep going: I had to do 186 job applications to receive the offer I wanted.,Finally, I wasn't expecting my collegues to be that awesome. There were people ranging from 24 to 62 years old, from undergrads to PhDs, from business background like myself to aerospace engineering. And we all struggled together, bonded, and learned a lot from each other strenghts and weekness.,Overall, I highly recommend the program, it truly changed my life and career. Using the same mental models I learned there I kept going deeper in deep learning (pun intended) and got a job in AI. I will always be grateful for Galvanize for making me start confidently a cycle of constant learning in a world full of data.
12/7/2016, • Data Scientist , • Graduate , •  Course: Data Science Immersive , •  Campus: San Francisco ,[object Object],[object Object],Galvanize is a BootCamp which is a type of educational institution. It is organized in a different way than a conventional collage or university. Its educational program oriented to teach theoretical part of data science in very quick way, so that students will learn only what is necessary to move on to the next step in leaning. The next step is hands-on practical experience when students lean how to use what they leaned in class by implementing it in practice. I would say that it is highly important to do as much as possible pre-course work yourself and even try to go beyond. The program is short, 12 weeks, and very intensive, so that even if you have background in one of the STEM fields, you still need to put a lot of effort into the data science immersive program. If your background is not one of the STEM fields I would say that you might consider to join master of data science program at Galvanize U instead of data science immersive.,The learning atmosphere at Galvanize is pretty non-formal, instructors are easy to approach and ask for any help student needs in understanding the material, the amount of time instructors spend with each student one on one is probably the greatest if compared to conventional collages.,Galvanize provides great support to students in the job search after graduation. This is the place where a student will find a lot of direct connections with employers in many companies, including the ones that are at the top in their fields of industry.,Overall, if you are planing on switching your career to data scientist and you feel like you need some training, I would definitely recommend to obtain that training from Galvanize.
12/7/2016, • Student , •  Campus: Fort Collins ,[object Object],[object Object],I am only 4 weeks into the Galvanize full stack Web Development program and I love it.  I knew it was going to be an intense learning experience, but I had no idea I would have learned so much so soon.  The instructors are great at giving you IT knowledge but also at keeping you from panicking from the intensity and being overwhelmed.  At the end of the week they ask us what we've learned this week, and when they list it on the board, we are awed that we learned something only on Monday, when it seems like we've had that knowledge for much longer.  I alread feel like I can do some pretty cool things and we're only just starting.  I've also talked to a lot of people from the other classes who are much further along than our cohort, and they are just as thrilled about the program as we are.  There are some things that don't work for us, but they have a daily feedback and incorporate changes to accomodate those needs the very next day.  It is a fantastic learning environment, but it is intense.
