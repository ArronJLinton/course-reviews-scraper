RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/9/17,    Full Stack Flex - Full Time ,    Somerset , GitHub,5,4,5,4,I'll admit when I signed up at the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp I was real nervous. I was scared that I wouldn't have a great support system and I would just barely survive the bootcamp. However all those fears disappeared the second I walked into the classroom.Â There I was surrounded by great students and faculty who wanted nothing more than to create coders who were going to \'crush it!\'Â The curriculum is intense to say the very least but you're learning the basic foundations that you can continue to build off of. There was no stone left unturned with the amount of information that we absorbed.I loved coming to class every day and be surrounded by these incredibly ambitious and goal driven students. We really were a little family together. I know for a fact that all of us are going to remain in touch and be the biggest cheerleaders when it comes to finding a job.The only thing I wish I did prior to becoming a student was code a little bit more. You can totally join the boot campÂ having zero coding background but sitting down and taking basic courses on Udemy was really helpful to me. I just wish I had done more! Â I absolutely recommend the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp to anyone who wants to change their lives and start a new career.Â ,223,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,6/13/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City , LinkedIn,4,5,5,2,"Before you read this write-up will be a bit too long this could be a mix of review overview and what to expect. If you're like me were admitted to the program had concerns and kept hunting for reviews a month before the class started I hope this will quell fears. It's understandable if you do its a lot of money and a huge investment but I'd do it again in a heartbeat. A lot of bootcamps expect you to quit your job to attend but RCB is held three days a week with hours that don't interfere with typical work hours which will be a plus for many.I attended the program in their Jersey City satellite location. My commute was about two and a half hours on a good day with public transportation from the Bronx but being right next to the PATH was extremely convenient.A little background on myself in case if there is someone who is reading is currently in the situation that I was in before I enrolled. I studied media studies but not too soon after graduating I realized the job market wasn't what I was expecting it to be for the field.I had a pretty good handle on HTML and CSS before starting the class as I had taken a few classes on them. When it came to JavaScript and everything else I had no idea about the technology that it took to make a website.Â Before I really took to dive I went through numerous tutorials and books to explore programming to see if it was for me.Â If you are highly considering programming as a career path and have no prior experience with code I suggest the following resources (in order of quality IMO):FreeCodeCampAdmissionsRutgers Coding Bootcamp wasn't the only program I tried to get into. I've applied to a lot and not every one of them has the same admissions process. Typically the higher-priced (or salary-based) ones have several rounds of coding tests and interviews. A lot of them were extremely daunting as they replicated the actual process of the application process for the typical programmer's position some of them even expected applicants to know recursion which baffled me. But applying to Rutgers was really pleasant compared to the other processes I went through. Some of them were so impersonal and demoralizing that I step away from coding for a few months.Rutgers started with a general info session with a Trilogy rep who gives you a run down of the program. Based on that conversation if you are ready the process starts and you'll have an interview with admissions. They'll take your background interest in the program and your experience with programming. From there you'll take an online multiple-choice assessment and then based on your score you'll have another interview session that's only slightly technical with a tricky logic question. It's worth noting that for every stage of the admissions process you'll be on the phone with someone which I did like since it added a human touch to it.After that it's only a few days before you get the final verdict. In all for me the process only took two weeks from speaking with an information rep to getting the decision and it was pretty painless.The Teaching StaffMy class was led by Peleke and Matt with Boris and Theory being the Teaching Assistants. These four are amazingly patient human beings who want nothing more than for you and your classmates to succeed. They will not only make learning code enjoyable and interesting they will teach you how to break down concepts remind you about the fundamentals and inspire you to push your brain to the limit. Don't hesitate to ask questions if you do they'll always have an answer. They are all very humble and empathetic and understand if you are having trouble picking up a concept they'll work tirelessly with you to make sure you are comfortable with it. They will go above and beyond to make sure that your projects are ready for deployment and bug-free even if it's into the wee hours of the night.With all of the terminologies and syntax it's hard to get a high-level understanding of things but with the program you'll have plenty of practice. Each class you'll have 10 or more activities that'll make use of each tech.But even if you are not assigned the same teaching staff I've had fear not as Trilogy is pretty good as sourcing their staff as they're all extremely knowledgeable and will pretty much have an answer to any question you throw at them.Your cohort is assigned a student success manager who is pretty much makes sure you're on track with your homework up to snub with the material provides info on the course and helps you get in touch with the various Trilogy Services. I haven't had to ask Kalimah for too many things but she was always great at helping me out and informing the class of changes and anything we need to do.The CourseThe program itself is excellent. The curriculum is finely tuned and top notch. For those who are concerned with only learning the newest and \'hottest\' tech and afraid that what you'll learn will be outdated have no fear. The curriculum team is constantly working on the course material and are always adjusting to what technology is in-demand at the moment like React JS. If somehow Vue JS becomes the next de-facto JavaScript framework I'm sure the team will adjust the curriculum to that. At the end of my cohort we were scheduled to spend a week (for each) on Java and Python but React JS had picked up so much steam we skipped those two and spent extra time on React.24 weeks sounds like a very long time but I didn't feel like it. Regardless of any program DO NOT expect that you will learn the in's and out's of any programming language. That is simply not enough time to master anything but it is enough time to get pretty good at something.The first 2 - 3 weeks you'll go through git and Github with a crash course in HTML and CSS. After that you'll get into JavaScript and jQuery. But right after that is where things pick-up with Node JS and the course starts getting interesting. By the end of the course you'll be comfortable with databases and frameworks like React JS.There is a homework assignment that's due two weeks from when it was assigned. Each homework assignment deals with the tech that is learned and you're given the option of doing assignments into difficulties one of them being the easier to do. In total there are three group projects which will expect you to make use of all the technology you have learned as well as incorporating anything not covered in class. These were extremely fun yet incredibly frustrating all for good reasons. They not only add to your portfolio but help you get a sense of how to work in a team version control and learn project management.Besides class time and work there are plenty of opportunities to learn provided by Trilogy throughout the 24 weeks. They do \'hackathons\' on a weekly basis typically on a Friday night where someone will teach a programming language not a part of the curriculum or go over something like React JS more in depth. These are done online with other cohorts alumni and teachers from other Trilogy programs around the country. They are really informative and voluntary so if you do have extra time outside of class work I definitely recommend doing them. They are recorded so if you miss them they are viewable once the videos are encoded and uploaded to Youtube.I haven't had to use them but Trilogy does provide tutoring services so if you do find yourself struggling with class work you can as for a 1-on-1 session and they are at no extra cost.Career ServicesDo not expect any sort of job placement from Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. From the very first day they will iterate that they do not have any sort of job placement program in place.Â They had workshops on how to build your online presence practice sessions for job interviews and webinars with industry folks.Â I had the impression that they were still ironing things out in their career service which is a real shame since the curriculum is quite excellent.While I didn't expect to be handed a job after graduation career services left a lot to be desired. There were tons of communication breakdowns or lack of. At times there were career service webinars scheduled during work hours which a lot of people couldn't attend.Â They did tell us for demo day/graduation that there was going to be a few hiring managers there to connect with but none showed up. Career serviceÂ was kind of a mess but they were in the middle of a revamp I guess. It would be nice if they organized meetup-like events. There are opportunities outside of class to network in the area but it could be tough getting to recruiters and hiring managers at those.The TakeawaysTL;DRÂ 	Overall based on the strength of the curriculum and the material you'll learn I can wholeheartedly recommend this program. Learning programming is very hard and it's easy to get into the notion that it's a breeze with bootcamps promising you to be a master programming in three months. The reality is you won't come out of any bootcamp as a master developer and you won't after completing this one. There is simply not enough time to learn everything. So with that programming is hard and the folks at Trilogy know this. Although career serviceÂ wasn't the most robust aspect it shouldn't deter you from considering this program you'll learn a lot and have fun doing it.Â *****If you feel that this is the program for you or you've already been admitted and preparing to start here are some things I suggest on doing:PRACTICE and REPEAT:GOOGLE is your best friend:Throw your ego into the Hudson River: Help your classmates out:Go all in on projects and homework assignments:",1685,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,6/8/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City , LinkedIn,5,5,5,3,I am so thankful that I found Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. I needed a program near where I lived from a trusted and reputable source that allowed me to continue working. The structure of this program is ideal for those who cannot give the 60-80 hours/week required by many full-time bootcamps. Not only that the slower pace over a 24 week program aids retention of concepts and affords time to apply new concepts creatively. I continued learning concepts that a bootcamp does not have the time to cover and explored tech outside the curriculum.Â Since this bootcamp is connected with a larger organization Trilogy Education Services with bootcamps and several major universities across the US the coding community is strong and the opportunites to learn from one another are great. Pavan Katepalli is the CLO for the organization. He holds weekly training sessions and miniHackathons where I met students from other bootcamps and learned new concepts and technology outside the normal curriculum. Trilogy also provides free tutoring services for students who need assistance. I was able to begin tutoring other students while in the program and continue tutoring to this day.,189,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,4/2/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Somerset , GitHub,5,4,5,3,"undefinedÂ Â  Â This program was a lot of fun and a great learning experience. In addition to learning web development the course touches on mobile apps as well! The instructors (shout out to Dan V Ahmed and Pavan) know their stuff and really go the extra mile to help students succeed. You will learn a lot of real world programming skills finish with a solid portfolio to showcase to employers and meet some like-minded friends along the way. Also having a Demo Day where you can network with employers at the end of the program was a huge plus. But you need to be realistic with your goals and expectations.Â undefinedYou may notice a lot of reviews on this page are either love it or hate it so I think you should ask yourself 3 questions before you commit to this course:	Here is some insight into the three questions above:	Â undefinedundefinedÂ Â  Â I actually graduated from Rutgers University with a 4 year degree and was in the workforce for two years before signing on to the bootcamp. I came from a Mechanical/Industrial Engineering background so I was no stranger to a difficult course load. I had a decent foundation in knowing how to code but I was missing a lot of the bigger picture parts of actually knowing how to create and deploy a website or app. The bootcamp filled all these gaps.Â undefinedÂ Â  Â The course felt very inclusive and it had an active Slack community were you could post questions chat with students and collaborate on projects. Having this community made it feel a lot more inclusive than my classroom experience in college. Outside of lecture there were also many (optional) video sessions you could attend (for no additional charge). These sessions included an Interview Weekly session where instructors and former bootcamp students talked about interviewing skills and how they liked working in tech. Other sessions also included Mini-Hackathons were instructors former students and people in the industry gave coding walkthroughs on making chat bots data analysis twitter bots etc.Â undefinedÂ Â  Â You could feel that the instructors and TAs really were passionate about coding and often took extra initiative to nail down concepts. I found my instructor Dan V to be very engaging during lecture and honestly he did a better job explaining concepts than most of my college professors. Some TAs were former bootcamp students but they are also very knowledgeable and helpful. Often top performing bootcamp graduates are asked to come on to the program as TAs.Â Â undefinedÂ Â  Â The course is true to itâ€™s â€œfull stackâ€ù name. You learn how to make a fully functional website that looks good feels responsive and connects to a database. As an added perk the course briefly touches on mobile app development too. The pace is quick but sustainable just be sure to keep up with the weekly homework assignments. The homework assignments are critical in learning the material thoroughly and they also become part of your portfolio to showcase to employers.Â undefinedÂ Â  Â The bootcamp does not guarantee job placement. I repeat the bootcamp does not offer job placement. The course is very up front about this but you should understand how this impacts your job search. After graduation other bootcamps take a percentage of your first yearâ€™s salary as payment for the course. Rutgers Coding Bootcamp does not it is based on a flat rate up front payment. While this often makes it cheaper to attend the bootcamp has no incentive to do your job search for you.Â Â  Â Instead the bootcamp offers job assistance. These include resume writing sessions networking techniques (and events) interviewing skills and learning how to maintain a LinkedIn presence. Overall I would say it was pretty helpful. To get the most out of career services you will need to be proactive. I recommend attending the Interview Weekly sessions and keeping your portfolio page and Github up-to-date. And presenting at Demo Day is a must!Â Â  Â Personally I found the job search more difficult than actually learning the course load. I sent out about 70 applications and rarely heard back from employers. Definitely avoid the temptation of a â€œone click applyâ€ù approach. From my observations I would say that the best approachÂ to landing a new job was by networking with current students bootcamp graduates and TAs/instructors.Â Ultimately I landed my current job by networking with a classmate.Â undefinedÂ  Â  Would I take the course again? Yes. Not only did I land a new job but I now have a sweet new hobby. The $9500 was a lot of money but I learned a lot of material quickly met like-minded students and have a very valuable skillet. I am writing this review 2 months after graduation. I skill keep in touch with my instructor and classmates.",787,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,2/27/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Somerset , LinkedIn,5,5,5,0,I have not yet graduated the course but I do feel confident enough to leave a review about this boot camp in the remaining time I have left.Prior to this boot camp Iâ€™ve had around 13 years of coding experience and was looking for something to fill any gaps I may have had. I spent months researching and even had chances at sponsorships at other schools. What turned me to Rutgers Coding Bootcamp was not only the name but also the reviews Iâ€™ve read about the instructors.Coming into the class I was a bit scared that maybe it would be difficult and perhaps fall behind but it turned out to be the complete opposite for me. With my prior experience in coding I found it extremely easy and was breezing through just about all the assignments that were given. Now Iâ€™m not saying Iâ€™m not learning anything new at allâ€_ I do pick up things here and there that I never knew before. Some of the stuff I picked up from class made my development life a bit easier.I cannot say this boot camp is taking me from zero to hero in terms of coding experience. For me itâ€™s just filling in missing bits and pieces.For my class I had Pavan and personally I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d choose anyone else. He is passionate about what he does shares his excitement with the class and just overall makes the entire course feel alive. I donâ€™t think any other instructor at any other school could top him. He is the real deal and he puts so much effort into his students you cannot go wrong with Pavan.Nowâ€_ if you were to ask me if I would join this class again I would say probably not. The reason being is because I have so much prior coding knowledge and $10000 is quite a bit of cash to only pick up bits here and there. If they offered an advanced course then Iâ€™d join it in a heartbeat. Do I regret joining this class? No. Iâ€™ve met some great people and hope the friendships and connections I got out of it last me a lifetime and to me that is worth the $10k.If you were to ask me who should join Rutgers Coding Bootcamp then Iâ€™d suggest anyone who considers joining has at least some background in code. If you happen to be someone who has no knowledge in programming then Iâ€™d HIGHLY suggest you learn from free online resources first. Doing so youâ€™ll find out if you enjoy coding and youâ€™ll have a head start if you do decide to join this boot camp.Who shouldnâ€™t join this boot camp? Someone who only looks at the salary instead of the big picture. Coding is an â€œartâ€ù and people who have a passion for it are the ones who succeed the most in this field. The salary is nice but what is the point if you wake up every day hating what you do? So really ask yourself if this is what you want to do.Overall this boot camp is worth the money if you have some prior experience and are looking to turn to this career path. Just be prepared for a lot of work. This easily turns into a full-time gig for some students.After I graduate I will update this review with updated information regarding career services my job search experience etc.,569,0

RUTGERS,TRILOGY,9/1/17,,,,5,5,5,4,The curriculum staff. and network of peers I have built up from the program helped me enact some profound changes in my life. The program helped me find the skillsÂ not only develop full stack web applications right now but also confidence and knowledgeÂ to diveÂ into newÂ software and languages.,47,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/9/17,,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,3,This course changed my life I found a career that I love and I have never been happier.The staff (instructors and TA's) were sooo patient and knowlegable. And really helped me learn the material.Â My only regret is working so much during the class. This course does take a lot of time.Â ,51,1
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/9/17,    Full Stack Flex - Full Time ,    Somerset ,,5,5,5,5,I attended Rutgers undergrad for computer science for a few semesters and became discouraged by the amount of time I had to spend on work for breadth requirement courses when I wanted to devote most of my time to computer science work. Â I'd find myself in the library writing papers and doing homework for courses that I had no interest in but was forced to take. Â Fast forward a few years and I saw the opportunity to take this Coding Bootcamp and jumped on it immediately.I took the 12 week (full-time) course rather than the 24 week (part-time) course and honestly I loved how condensed it was. Â Going into it I thought I'd have trouble paying attention through a five hour class every day but I quickly found that most days class would end and I wished that it was longer. Â If you take the 12 week course it's definitely very important to stay on top of the assignments but as long as you start the homework a reasonable amount of time before the due date it's no problem to get it finished and even find a little extra time to add your own flair to it.For a little context I had some experience in Java but it was so far in the past for me that I didn't utilize it much. Â I worked three nights a week as well so it's possible to have a job at the same time but I wouldn't overload your schedule. Â Especially towards the tail end of the course. Â Many students hadÂ zero prior experience in coding prior to the bootcamp and while some struggled in the beginning to pick up core concepts they all finished the course as fantastic coders. Â I would work with any single one of them in the future. Â I just finished yesterday so I can't really speak on job placement but they have a career services department who will help you craft your resume teach you what questions you will encounter in interviews and set you up with recruiting agencies. Â We even had a few recruiters attend the presentation for our final projects which was cool.Our instructor Franklin Dawes was amazing. Â Super helpful always took the time to answer questions thoroughly. Â He'd go over the same thing several times if necessary but somehow still managed to keep us on track with the curriculum every day. Â Alan Chu and Tom Keel were our TA's and they were just as fantastic. Â Really supportive people who attended the bootcamp in a prior session and came out very knowledgeable. Â We had a few other guest TA's Aaron Mark Tammer Rob I'm sure I'm missing some. Â They were all great too and someone in my class by the name of Adam Kwan will be a TA for the next full time course I believe. Â He was an all star all semester in our class and pretty much acted as a third TA for a lot of us so I'm sure he'll be awesome. Â Finally Juanita SorannoÂ helped out with career services and acted as our cheerleader throughout the course. Â She's super helpful knows her stuff when it comes to coding and is very accomodating if anything arises.Bottom line if you want to learn to be a web developerÂ in 12 or 24 weeks you can't go wrong taking this course. Â It's not easy so take it seriously but I think you'll find it less and less of a chore as you get farther into the course to keep up and more just something you want to do.,590,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,7/15/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,After searching for two years on what should I learn next I stumbled into the Rutgers Bootcamp at first I was skeptical but after doing some research I decidedÂ to join. After the first couple of lessons I knew this was going to be challenging; see I came from a hardware background and had no idea what coding was. The program advisor told me to go and practice in code academyÂ before the class starts and as a good slacker I totally forgot. So when the class started I was zero in programming but Ahmed (my instructor) was such an awesome teacher that I got to understand the concepts being taught to a high level This is not an easy course and it is not for everyone you need to have the drive to learn and push beyond your limits \'IS LIKE STARTING TO LEARN A LANGUAGE FROM SCRATCH\'. I just want to thank all the staff for the time being put into this course and especially Ahmed for being Great. Â \'Another One\'! I will always remember this course as a life changing experience!!!!. After graduating I can say I am a developer with the capacity to keep on learning new programming languages becauseÂ I have not just learned how to code in this program \'I have learned how to learn\'.,218,1

RUTGERS,TRILOGY,6/7/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,I came into this course with no technical experience whatsoever. I had a desire to add to my skillset in a changing employment landscape. This course was one of the most difficult frustrating and humbling educational experience I've ever had.Â I had some incredible instructors and other students lept at the chance to help those who were struggling. I think a collaborative environment is pretty essential in a course like this and Rutgers Coding Bootcamp delivered on that one hundred percent. While the program advertises itself as one that will help you transition to a pure development I think it's easy to see that everyone -- folks with writing backgrounds like myself included -- should at the very least have a better understanding of the underlying technologies of the web. I would wholeheartedly reccomend the course.Â ,135,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,4/17/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,4,5,5,4,This will be a short review but what I wanted to concentrate on is the faculty and staff. Going in as a blank slate in regards to Dev I was certainly worried about my ability to keep up with the curriculum and rest of class. But the Ahmed (my instructor) was easily the best teacher I've had in my life. With an ability to put difficult concepts into simpler terms and with the support of the TA's and classmates this was the most enjoyable learning experience I've ever had. Do yourself a favor and take the plunge as this may become the mostÂ important six-months in your life!,107,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,2/21/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,The Rutgers Coding Bootcamp program is the best investment I have made forÂ my future as a web developer. Â This course is in depth and intellectually challenging. Â The professor and the TAs knew how challening the course was and therefore went above and beyond to assist every student. Â Ahmed Nate and Will were always available for help with homework and to encourageÂ students who began to doubt themselves. Â I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to pursue a career in web development.,82,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,2/7/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,At Rutgers Coding Bootcamp the pace was fast and the work was intense. But thanks to Ahmed's light-hearted teaching style the classes felt fun even when I was really challenged. The instruction was clear and it was obvious that a lot of thought had been put into the curriculum design. At the end of the course you will not only know full-stack web development but you will have a good understanding of howÂ to teach yourself any other programming language or technical skill. Really the process is made that clear.Â In addition to the regular classes students enrolled in the program have the opportunity to take a plethora of free workshops. Knowing how important it is to keep abreast of up and coming technologies they provided us with a chance to learn Elixir and Phoenix. Since I have a graphic design background I especially appreciated the free workshops on UI and D3.js that I was able to take.Â In fact alumni get to participate in a lot of the free workshops too. The entire team is very supportive of the alumnis continuing education.Â ,180,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,2/4/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,4,5,4,I'm confident that given the time I could have learned everything I learned in the program on my own. However as I've heard emphasized several times now the best software engineers are not just masters of the technical aspectsÂ but they're excellent communicators and collaborators. Such soft skills are easy to miss if you don't have the environment that this class provides. If you want to make the most of it I strongly encourage that you connect with fellow students instructors TAs and speakers. Though it may not be immediately apparent the indirect effect of making that effort will pay off.Overall Ahmed was an excellent instructor the TAs were helpful the students were engaged and I'm happy with the results.,119,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,1/23/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,4,My experience with the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp was phenomenal. I had tried to learn some web development basics on my own prior to the class but I was never as successful as with the bootcampâ€™s guided learning. They provided the structure that I needed to make sense of a field that can seem incredibly daunting and complex for someone coming from an entirely different world. They helped me learn how to learn so I could continue even after the class ends.Â With all that said there is nothing that will substitute hard work and hours of dedication. The immense dedication with which Ahmed our instructor went into each class was inspiring. He really went above and beyond to ensure that everyone received a well-rounded experience. Learning to code is like learning a new language. Put the work into it and you open a new world of possibilities. Nothing is handed to you but thereâ€™s always someone there to help you if you feel like youâ€™re struggling. Itâ€™s an investment in yourself that you have to work hard at but youâ€™re never alone.Â ,181,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,1/23/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,I highly recommend RCB to anyone looking to get into web development. I have a background in business and prior to joining I had a little bit of knowledge about HTML and CSS from online courses. I felt like I was at a stand still because I wanted a formal and immersive learning experience. Grad school was too long considering the tech field is continuously changing and the bootcamps I found either required a background in tech/computer science or seemed like a waste of time and money. Not only did I learn a lot while attending RCB but this experience has been truly life changing. I'm leaving RCB with a very strong foundation and the knowledge I've gained is transferable to other languages and frameworks I'm interested in learning. Everything I've learned is directly relevant to what an entry level/junior developer requires.I attended the Jersey City location and Ahmed was my instructor. He's extremely knowledgeable committed and ALWAYS available. The class picks up quickly. The first two weeks we learned HTML and CSS and by the third week we moved onto JavaScript and then Jquery. The classes usually started out with a lecture and then we moved onto exercises (sometimes we worked individually or did pair programming). Like most things in life you get what you put in. If you are dedicated and proactive I'm sure you will be very satisfied with your experience at RCB.,236,1
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,1/20/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,I absolutely loved the bootcamp. The curriculum was very intensive but I felt that it taught us the necessary languages and discipline to not only dip our feet into the Web Development world but succeed if the right amount of time and work was put into the class. It was NOT easy at any point in the course but I was lucky enough to have an AMAZING instructor (Ahmed) and two AMAZING tutor assistants (Nate and Will). There was an endless amount of support literally 24/7. I never felt like I was bothering anyone when I asked for help and never felt that I was so lost that I wouldn't be able to catch up (which was my biggest fear coming into this bootcamp). My instructor genuinely wanted to be there and help all of us succeed. Aside from the education aspect my instructor classmates and TA's have helped me grow as a professional and also as a person. I am forever grateful for my whole RCB team.,168,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,12/21/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,4,4,4,4,I found RCB at a time in my life when things weren't adding upÂ as they should. Do well on your SAT's get into college and you'll get a good job they said. But this \'lifeÂ formula\' turned out not to work for me.Â I thought I was doing everything right but eventually found myself not being able to wake upÂ happyÂ every morning.Â I decided toÂ finally bite the bullet and sign up for a coding bootcamp. I had nothing to lose.The main reason I chose this program over others was because of its proximity as well as theÂ flexibility in the part-time program. I had to workÂ full-time while attending the class so this was my biggest concern. TheÂ curriculum offerings were also standard with the industry. As well the bootcamp wasÂ offered through Rutgers University and I liked that I got a little bit of \'college experience\' out of it. Students ranged widely in ages profession and skill level but I found that it was a safe place to network withÂ others without feeling judged. It helped me become comfortable to talk to other \'coders\' and maybe one day call myself that.The greatest advantage of a having face-to-face class was that if I needed hand-holding I couldÂ always find someone to talk to. But to really excel I had to be able to push past myÂ own limitations. The lectures provided a foundation on which I could exercise my creativity when doing the homework. The most helpful sessioins wereÂ doing a timed coding test in class and doing mock interviews with live feedback.Â I think that whether one graduatesÂ still a novice or an employable professional largely depends onÂ an array of personal factors but previous coding experience is not one of them. Learning is a lifelong skill and practice makes perfect; I felt that RCB did a good job of emphasizingÂ that. When it came to applying for jobs the biggest threshold for me was gettingÂ an interview. Sending a resume was definitely not enough and Career Services was able to help me get in the door on more thanÂ a few occassions. Demo Day pushed me to get my portfolio ready and practiceÂ talking with employers.Â In fact I found that it wasn'tÂ difficult to demonstrate my skills and willingness to keep learning.Â When I started RCB in January I was despondent and unsure of what \'path\' in life I was taking. For the first few weeks I forced myself to get into the routine of squeezing in time for a quick dinner between work and class and trying to not fall behind. But it wasn't long beforeÂ I found myself doing all-nighters because I wanted toÂ and gaining a sense of accomplishment when I made thatÂ final pushÂ to GitHub for all the world to see. (And then pushing it again a few minutes later because of a bug.)And now entering into the last few weeks of the year I am starting a new job and I am a lot more optimisticÂ with the direction I am going. Thank you to a great instructor and friend Ahmed to the best section TA's Peter and Faisal and also to Quincy for fielding all my in-class questions Patrick for the intro to PythonÂ and Peleke for taking an hour out of your time to talk about RxJS. Also to Stacey for always telling me where to park toÂ Career Services especiallyÂ NalaniÂ and Zach who were great to work with and kept me motivated post-graduation and to my family and friends for their encouragement and support along the way. What a year it's been and I can't wait for the next!,581,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,9/14/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,Taking this course was honestly the best decision I ever made. Â I was in a career I was not happy with and I always wanted to learn to codeÂ so that'sÂ when I choose to apply to the bootcamp. Â The instructorÂ was fantastic the TAs are always there to help either in person or through the internet. Â I learned so much through the course and now I have a full-time job as a developer and I am so much happier with my career. Â The curriculum was very good and focused on teaching students technologies that the market needs developers for. Â The job assistance was fantastic as well the student success coordinator I was assigned stayed in touch and set up phone calls to talk about my job search often and didn'tÂ stop until I had got an offer.Â ,134,1
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,9/11/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,I recently graduated from the program in July 2016 and life has just not been the same since (pardon the cliche). I must admit that at about the 3 week mark I began asking myself if I could have gone the self teaching route that others have offered as an alternative. For me it would not have been a stretch since I have a background in IT (comp sci undergrad MIS grad). Web development was something I was interested in because so much of my prior experience had been on the systems side (process improvment project management quality assurance) and I was looking to transition myÂ career track towards somethingÂ that was more \'hands on\' if you will. Plus it's easier for developers to telecommute; systems people usually have to be at the office.Â Now that I've completed the program I know that I would not have nearly the amount of knowledge had I tried to self teach the skills I learned at the RCB. I am the parent ofÂ a soon-to-be 3 year old and a soon-to-be 1 year old at home so \'self\' anything is just about non-existent. I was lucky enough to be able to get to class 3 days a week for 6 months duringÂ which time I learned not only all the languages frameworks and other technologies that enable me to build complete web apps from scratch but also some intangible lessons in collaboration team building and problem resolution. Most importantly I got to work with knowledgeable personable people students and staffÂ many of which I hope to keep in contact with years to come.Â As far as the curriculum I felt that the course moved along in a natural progression and atÂ a very rapid pace which I liked -Â it wouldn't be much of a 'bootcamp' if it didn't. Of course there were times when I felt overwhelmed and there is a lot of pressure to not fall behind in the material. I was always able to get help from TAs/Instructors when I needed it and the career services support is stellar. I personally was able to earn myself a nice raise at my present job along with some other incentives and accolades with the skills I learned at the RCB.Â If you are looking for a career change or even just a skills retooling for Web development I would highly recommend the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. The format curriculum and support staff are all top-notch indicative of the Rutgers namesake.Â You must remember however that you MUST be willing and able to put in the work outside of attending classes. As with so many other things in life what you get out of this program will depend enormously on what you are willing to put into it.Â ,453,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,9/9/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,4,5,5,First off I just want to start by saying that this was the best academic experience of my life. I have struggled with staying excited and motivated in the traditional university experience for years. Ahmed my instructor was the best teacher I have ever had. The TA's Peter Faisal Dan and many others were some of the best mentors I have ever had. Career Services has brought me so many different exciting opportunities I would have never been able to find on my own. And my fellow students were some of the nicest most helpful people I have ever met. Okay with that being said here is my breakdown of the 6 month adventure that was Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.Â I was in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp and graduated about a month and a half ago. It was a great experience. I felt like I have a group of people that I will be friends with for the rest of my life. That includes the studentsteachersÂ TA's and career services people. On top of the great social experience I had a great experience academically as well. I am definitely at the level of a junior level web developer. When going into this I did a lot of research on coding bootcamps and a few pieces of advice I listened to helped me a lot. Many people that had negative reviews on bootcamps said that the pace was too much (not from RCB but from other bootcamps). I am in no means the fastest learner. Going into a 6 month part-time program and coming out a competent full-stack developer was definitely a daunting task. What I did that helped with the pace of the program was actually did all the prework plus I went over the curriculum and did some of my own additional work (html css light js). So going into the program it was if I took a prerequisite for the bootcamp. So in the program IÂ definitely struggled but with the help of my fellow students as well as TA's and awesome instructor Ahmed. I can't describe how amazing they were. So before the program was over I had one freelance job and than since the program was over I have done contract work with one company have had numerous clients contacting me for freelance work and have went on two interviews. Remember that this has only been a month and a half out of the program. Nalani and the rest of career services have been working their a**es of to get us jobs and it really shows.Â Ultimately it has been said time and time again. These people are giving you great resources and amazing staffÂ Â and providing you with a great platform and experience... What you do with it is what will determine your success during and after the program.Â ,467,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,9/8/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,4,I graduate from this bootcamp next month (October 2016)Â and am proud to say that I've learned a ton over the last ~5 months. The TAs and instructors really care and do what they can to help us succeed our Slack community is very active and they are always on there answering people's questions when we are not physically in class. All the classes are recorded and you can go back and watch them any time. And the vast majority of the people in the class have kept up with material so one can derive that the pace is ideal even for those with full-time jobs (of which there are many). The biggest testament to this fact are the recent round of group projects which we presented for the class and wereÂ We have classes 3x a week with the students being split between Monday/Wednesday and Tuesday/Thursday classes and everyone meeting on Saturday. I'm in the Tuesday/Thursday groupÂ and our instructor Matt Kim is The instructors are very helpful and stay late after each class to help those who need it and are very responsive online as I've said but we are expected to do our best to reinforce new concepts and research things we don't understand. This is how coding works: StackOverflow and Google are huge parts of the job. Your future employer can't (yet) install new knowledge directly into your brain via some microchip or spend hours explaining every nuance of a new concept. You will be expected to know how to learn and self-reliance in this area is crucial.We started off learning front-end design including HTML CSS Bootstrap Javascript jQuery etc. and moved on roughly half way through the course to back-end development focusing on Node.js.Â Now we areÂ going back to the front-endÂ learning React. I feel as though I have a solid balanced understanding of web development and feel I've builtÂ up the necessary base of skills to teach myself any new programming concepts or languages that I need to know in the future. These days I have a strong sense of optimism about my future being excited to take what I've learned and apply it to create something awesome.__All that being said there are a few categories of people who might fall behind to the point where they need to drop out:1) People whoÂ 2) People who areÂ 3) People who know nothing about computers or coding. The course doesn't assume much foreknowledge but it would be very wise to study HTML CSS and Javascript to some degree before coming in even if that means just taking the corresponding Codecademy classes. This will give you a good head start and prevent you from getting overwhelmed freaking out and starting to believe that you're not smart enough to learn to code.__I started learning HTML CSS and Ruby on Rails a few months before the course so the first few weeks weren't too challenging for me. I worried that the class would be too easy but the pace quickly picked up and the work became quite challenging and continues to be so. That said challenge is how we learn and I am grateful to be learning so much in a relatively short amount of time.I have yet to begin the career services part of the Bootcamp which begins after we technically 'graduate' and is something we have to apply for and meet certain requirements. I gave \'job assistance\' 4 stars because I would have liked the job assistance requirements to be less intimidating--but they are still manageable. Based on my experience with the class I expect that the career services will be very helpful for landing a job after the course ends. We have had career services talks on various Saturday classesÂ which have provided us with great resume and LinkedIn advice.__Overall I would definitely recommend Rutgers Coding Bootcamp and am happy to have found such a great bootcamp in New Jersey.Â I'm wholeheartedly grateful for my experience here.,652,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,9/6/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,I recently graduated from the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp and I couldn't feel more proud of myself.Going into this I knew the program would be intense and a lot of responsibility would fall on me to keep up with the workload. I was able to complete this program while attending work full time and dealing with the many ups and downs that life likes to throw at us.The first two months of the program were met with feelings of hope excitement frustration and an overall feeling of being lost.While the instructors do their best and will go above and beyond to help it is up to us as students to help them guide us. I realized this a few weeks in. Learning to code is nothing like sitting in class for four years to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree.In order to make the most out of the class reach out to the instructor go to office hours and practice a little every day. If you do this you will be off to a great start. Also reach out to your peers and learn with them; they are probably just as nervous as you. The work can be intimidating but let go of the fear and be open to having your mind challenged in the best of ways.Halfway through the program is when I started feeling a little more comfortable and looking back at everything that I had learned and accomplished. Take pride in even the smallest steps because they will push you even further. At times I still felt lost on some concepts but all I needed to do was put in more time to learn on my own and ask the instructor for a one on one.Towards the end of the class almost everyone was still nervous and worried about being prepared for a job in this field. This feeling is okay after talking to people in the field even they still feel lost sometimes. Coding is about accepting the fact that you will never know everything but being open to learning anything. Follow what your interest are and stay passionate. Even if you don't find a job right away keep at it and stay positive.All of the instructors for this program have been amazing. I have worked mostly with Ahmed and he has been an inspiration to me. He was always positive and helped lift my spirits when I was ready to walk away. Don't be afraid to reach out to the instructors if you are having a hard time and need support they are understanding and want you to succeed.As for the career services portion of the class they put together a lot of networking events to attend; however I personally couldn't make some of them due to work constraints. Even with this they do offer many networking experiences to take advantage of as well as assistance with your resume and portfolio.Something to keep in mind is that this program is constantly developing and growing stronger with every month that passes and every class that graduates. While the program isn't a smooth easy ride into the hands of a successful job offer I would definitely recommend it to everyone interested in coding. This program challenges you as a person as a coder and as a student. There are many lessons to be had. Take advantage of all the resources they provide to you and make the most out of it. You get what you put in much like the garbage in garbage out expression.Another huge positive for me was the flexibility of the course and being able to work full time while furthering my education. Iâ€™d also like to add a personal note from my experience as a woman in this field/program to other woman. There is a great amount of support for us in this field if you know where to look. Reach out to the instructors and career services as they will guide you to helpful resources. Donâ€™t be intimidated if you walk into a class with only a handful of woman. Once everyone gets to know each other and the walls come down amazing things happen. Everyone was great and willing to help. Even if you do happen to come across a not so pleasant person just remember maybe they are having a hard time themselves.For anyone interested in this class donâ€™t let your mind trick you into thinking you are less than and that you canâ€™t do it. I know I struggled with that and looking back now I am very proud of myself for the applications that I have built and the knowledge that I take with me. As well as the friends and long term support that I have come away with. Donâ€™t give up - follow your dreams.Update: I was able to find a lucrative job shortly after the program while the job doesn't focus on coding alone it is in the IT field and there will be times that I can use my coding skills. The decision to take this job over a strictly web based development job was a personal one as it combined another passion of mine. I am very grateful for the coding bootcamp as this showed the interviewer that I was dedicated hardworking and willing to put in effort. The excellent recommendation from the instructor helped greatly!Iâ€™ll leave you with a cheesy yet feel good quote - I know they have helped me keep going when I least expected it.\'If your dreams do not scare you they are not big enough\' - Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,930,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/28/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,I can definitely reccomend the bootcamp to anyone who is roughly in my position -- I had a little prior experience doing programming and a little bit of familiarity with the unix command line but that was it. Â I had never worked in IT and hadn't touched a programming language or tried to hand code HTML since high school. Â The only javascript I knew was learned from a couple days of working through tutorials on Codeacademy before classes began. Â My point is that I had to rely on the two lead instructors (and the TAs) to learn Javascript Jquery SQL React MongoDB and Node/Express from scratch. Â They didÂ a very good job of guiding students such as myself through some very demanding arcane sometimes frustrating technical subject matter. Â They did a great job of patiently working through students' questions on everything from CSS positioning to callback functions to general questions about web development as a career. Â And yes it definitely showed that they were professional web developers rather than say CS researchers.Anyway they got the job done which for me was to learn how to sit down at an IDE and be able to write a basic 'MEARN' stack web app from scratch. Â Also I found the cirriculum was pretty well-designed. Â It follows a pretty sensible trajectory from HTML CSS and JS/JqueryÂ through nodejsÂ server programming/routing/etc then databases and then finally JS frameworks interrupted by three 2-4 week group projects. Â It's all javascript/node js so you get a good opportunity to learn a very popular language intensively. Â I really could not imagine putting together a similar learning experience for myselfÂ through self-study or taking an assortment of online courses.So again I definitely reccomend this program if you've made the decision that you 1. enjoy programming but aren't an expert andÂ 2. want to work as a web developer. Â Don't do it (or any bootcamp) if you can't answer yes confidently to 1 and 2. Â To address one last thing -- the job assistance so far has been pretty good. Â I've gotten plenty of helpful feedback on cover letters and have found that they take a very active role in checking in on the job search process. Â Much much better than what I experienced in my four years as an undergraduate long ago. Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ,379,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/25/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,Return on Investment. Keep that term etched on your memoryÂ when you sign up for any bootcamp when you enroll in a university when you join a gym etc. You will get exactly what you put into this. Just as your personal trainer can't lift for you and give you an eight pack the staff can't MAKE you learn the material- that will be up to you.Time for theÂ review: There are no books but then again this is a web dev course. Market reasearch was conducted (and is constantly being conducted for future cohorts)Â in order to put the curriculum together so there's that.Â The instructors and the TAs are excellent - they really want to see everyone succeed. I've never experienced a more accessible and encouragingÂ staff both inside and outside of the classroom. The most awesome part is that for the TAs and the instructors it doesn't seem like it's over post graduation. There's hackathons that are planned and they're still available and eagerÂ to help.Â As far as the career help goes I'm still riding out out my current contract to completion so I momentarily opted out.Now back to my annoying \'ROI\' statement above.Â You get exactly what you put into this course. For some people the course went too slow for others it went too fast- but it's really up to you to make it just right. There are a lot of comp sci grads that take this course as well as people who studied things and have worked in fieldsÂ that had absolutely nothing to do IT - I'm one of the latter. That means that I had to put in double or even triple the effort than some of my peers (this was exceedingly difficult to accomplish with a FT job) but it's what I signed up for.To me the course went extremely fast in terms of the 6 monthÂ life span. Again it's not due to a problem with the curriculumn but more of the fact that I still feel uneasyÂ with my code as yet again this hasÂ been a complete change for me.Â However the learning doesn't start and stop in relation to class-Â you really have to put in the work. The instructors and the TAs truly care and make themselves available but it's up to you to make those 10k count.Also I'd like to give a quick shout outÂ to my peers- they are truly a great bunch. I made lots of new friendshipsÂ was exposed to many ideas andÂ differing ways of approaching programming through the minds of other budding developers.,417,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/24/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,Met some of the greatest people while learning significant knowledge of the latest technologies in building web and mobile applications at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.

RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/24/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,I'm a recent RCB graduate and I had a wonderful experience.Â The instructors are always there to help and guide youÂ and the TAs stay late to answer your questions. You will learn a lot. Their curriculum is solid but it's up to you to show up to class ready to work. All of the classÂ lectures are recorded and available for students to view at anytime (even after you graduate!) Â along with the correspondingÂ lesson plan. Each week there is a new homework assignment. Take these seriously as they will account for your portfolio. The job assistance is great too. TheÂ career department motivatesÂ you to connect with employers leading up to graduation and well after you've graduated.Â Overall I am satisfied with RCB and I would recommend the program!Â ,124,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/23/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,I wanted to change my profession and thats why I joined RCB and that was the best decision ever.Â I had zero experience in computer programming before Â I joined RCB but after six months of intense course I feel very confident and proud of myself. My instructor Ahmed Haque was very enthusiastic and always available to help students. The TAs are very very good. There were so many times they had sacrificed there personal time just to help me. At one point I needed some extra help and they actually schedule two extra virtual classes for me .Â The timings and location of the classes are such that one can continue their job and study at the same time. They cover so many things in short time so the pace is little fast but bright side of it is we get to learn so many things.Â They provide lot of information and help. Practice will make you successful. I would totally recommend this course.,161,1

RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/22/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,Prior to Rutgers Coding Bootcamp I had been working at an Apple Retail Store for 4 years. During my time there I became interested in software development but they didn't really have much in the way of assistance in transitioning from Retail to Corporate doing anything other than retail related things.A lot of what you learn at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp is HOW TO LEARN. So there's a lot of reading documentation asking for help on stackoverflow googling. This is literally half of what a software developer does at work in the real world. So finding answers to unfamiliar problems is a skill in and of itself. You do get plenty of help and support from instructors and TA's but thing's aren't just spoon fed to you because the idea is to train you to be able to work a developer job after or even before the program ends.,148,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/22/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,4,4,3,I had graduated with a masters in biotechnologyÂ two years prior and knew I didn't want to continue with it. Â I played around with the idea of coding for a while and finally decided to pull the trigger when I learned about RCB. Truthfully the coding bootcamp concept didn't sit too well with me at firstÂ but as I got to talking to the people who run the programÂ in the interviews I felt that it was a good investment.I was part of the very first cohort- the instructors and TAs were dedicated every step of the way to making sure that we think like engineers and problem solvers. They were available for questions outside class time and were always excited to help us understand and diagnose the things that were blocking progress.Since I was working while I was doing the bootcamp I wasn't rushingÂ to find a job and didn't really rely on the job support aspect of the bootcamp. Â I applied around to a few different companies after graduationÂ and kept in contact with the awesome career advisor to talk through my thoughts in navigating the murky waters of interviewing. Â She alwaysÂ listened carefullyÂ and gave me good advice.About two months after graduating from the program I left my job at a global pharma company to work as aÂ developer. Â I'm really happy that RCB helped me make that change in my life.If you are looking to add a new dimension to your career orÂ change up your career and are also hungry to learn then this program is definitely for you.,255,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/21/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,4,5,5,4,I enrolled in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp's Full-Stack Flex program with very little experience in programming. Having gone through the program I can't begin to recommend this bootcamp enough. IÂ feel as though I've been given all of the tools necessary to not only get begin my career as a developer but to become extremely successful as I continue on in the field of software development.Â The instructors for my section of the class were incredibly knowledgeable and were always willing to go the extra mile when I was feeling lost. I always knew that if I got stuck I could ask any instructor at any point in the day and they would go above and beyond to make sure that the core concepts were clear and that I felt comfortable applying these concepts to the projects I was working on. At certain points some of the instructors were even willing to drop what they were doing to start a Google hangout so that we could share screens and walk through code line by line together.Â The biggest reason for recommending Rutgers Coding Bootcamp is because they worked extremely hard to make sure we had the confidence necessary to go into our first round of challenging technical interviews. They were quick to point out strengths in your work and provide constructive feedback for areas of opportunity. Despite the many points of frustration that come with learning to code the instructors were always there to keep you on track.Â All in all my experience at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp gave me the skills and confidence needed to start a career in software development and I strongly encourage anyone looking to break into the field to apply for this program.Â Â ,282,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/20/16,,    Jersey City ,,1,1,1,1,From beginning to the end it's broken promises. They fly through the material and don't get through the lesson plans and tell you if you have any questions to google it. The instructors don't help you at all . During the admission process they make it seem like it is a very selective process but no one is turned away. Any one who can pay the tuition will be accepted . The Â people in the class are mostly high school drop outs looking for a fast way to make money. So there is no way a person will be successful in theat type of environment.I found the same course online which is totally free and you can learn at your own pace . Homework is not graded feedback is not given and when they do help they do the work for you which defeats the purpose of learning . Save your time and money don't make the same mistake I made. Â During the entry process they make coding some easy and it's not. They don't offer books and everything they teach is not even used in today's market. I graduated received my certificate and every job offer I received was 14-16 Â  Dollars an hour as a entry level developer. Spend the extra money and go to a real schoolThe student success manager is very manipulative she will sweet talk you all the way through and let you continue drowning . Once the course is overÂ they will tell you that you do not qualify for job assistance since all the course requirements were not met. Â The rules are made up as the course is made. The name is Rutgers but is actually a 3 Rd party who runs the course. They offered me to teach the course after I graduated which goes to show how desperate they are for help. I have a masters in mathematics so I know I am not dumb. My instructor that was teaching the course was a front end developer which is a entry level developer.The instructors and tas come in 5 minutes before class starts when they are suppose to come in 45 minutes earlier before class starts to help students but they don't . The deadline to drop the course is 2 weeks. The first 2 weeks are the best after 2 weeks when you are locked in to the contract that is when they really show you the course is going to be.Â I have shared my experience read all the reviews before making a commitment. The positive reviews look like inside reviews.Â Â ,430,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/19/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,4,Going to RCB was honestly one of the best decisions of my life. Â It isn't an easy program it's challenging and exhausting but in a really really good way. Â The way this program is taught forces you to not only learn the class curriculum but also spend a significant amount of time out of class learning on your own. Â This program made me feel confident enough in my skills to quit my job and have a complete career change. Â It was a terrifying risk to take but it was the best decision I've ever made and I wouldn't have done it without this program. Â Looking back to where I was 6 months ago I am absolutely amazed at the things I can do. Â The instructors and TAs were excellent.Â They actually cared about the success of each student in the class which is extremely important when you are doing such a challenging program. Â I highly recommend this program to anyone who has the drive and enthusiasm necessary to become a web developer.,171,2
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/19/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,4,Full-Disclosure: The boot camp hired me toward the end of the course as a part-time curriculum consultant.I enrolled inÂ this course to learn the process of creatingÂ web apps with Node.js. There's a lot of technology involved when building out a full-stack project: markdown filesÂ JavaScript logic API routing database management version control and so on. I tried relying on online resources to study this info but the vast amount of content available made it arduous to chart out a clear learning path on my own. This led me to seeking out a nearby coding boot campÂ Rutgers being the closest (30 minute driveÂ to New BrunswickÂ vs 90 minute train to NYC).The courseÂ focusedÂ on the various components of a modern web app and moved through this material in a cohesive direction (database management before the Express framework essential full-stack tech before trending libraries like React and Angular etc.). My instructor Ahmed Haque taught each lecture with a friendly and energetic toneâ€”his speaking style brought down to earthÂ the abstractions and complexities inherent to web development.Â The instructor and TAs always provided exceptional assistance whether I needed a quick clarification or a more in-depth rundownâ€”they always made sure I understood the material before helping the next student. Ahmed even created video tutorials for us to view on our own time for some of the tougher concepts.While 24 weeks makes for a lengthy course the wide breadth of client- and server-side technologies covered in this span gave the boot camp a briskÂ pace. Still by paying attentionÂ to the lecturesÂ studying outside the classroom and takingÂ advantage of the one-to-one supportÂ IÂ came out able to build full-stack apps with different frameworks and databases. Would recommend to anyone looking to do the same.Â ,277,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/18/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,4,4,5,1,I'm going to make this review as detailed as possible I feel as though there aren't many testimonials for RCB out there and thanks to some SEO magic this pops up first.Â First of all long story short I was in the January 2016 cohort of the New Brunswick class and by the fifth month of the program I was fielding a number of job offers by a number of companies ranging from small startups to big corporations. I came into the program with zero coding experience and took this course along with my college coursework (I was in the final semester of my senior year at Rutgers). No my degrees were not in computer science.Â Yes my offers were more favorable than a number of my friends who graduated with a degree in CS.Â Every single line of code I typed was taught to me by my instructors: John and Ahmed. John was my main instructor while Ahmed instructed both sections of the January cohort on Saturdays. It cannot be overstated how incredible these two were at teaching us the beast that is Javascript. John was extremely patient with all of the students and kept us all engaged into the wee hours of the night on Tuesdays and Thursdays. He even stayed after class was finished on most nights to further aid students that needed extra help. John's teaching abilities surpassed that of the tenured professors that I studied under at Rutgers University. He also has a sense of humor that helped keep things light when Node or MySQL were beating us into the ground. I would not be at my job in my apartment or in my social standing right now if it were not for John.Â This sounds like a cinderella story which is why you're probably wondering about the one-star in the Job Assistance category. I would give it zero stars if I could. The reason why I decided to pay $9000 for this program was to not only learn how to be a software developer but to also enmesh myself into the network of connections that was advertised to me when I inquired about the program. At my initial inquiry I was told that we would eventually be working with companies on projects to see what it would be like to be a real-life developer. Didn't happen. During the first few weeks we were actually shown PowerPoints listing various companies who were connected asÂ hiring partnersÂ to the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. It pains me to say that these hiring partners were non-existent when it came time to look for jobs.Â During the entirety of the program career services would take literal WEEKS to answer my messages about any topic at all. No matter how small or big the issue. By the fourth month I felt as though I was ready to begin applying for jobs. Due to the negligence of career services I sought advice from Ahmed about how to approach employers how to negotiate a fair salary and other important things about the technological job market in which I was not familiar. Thanks to Ahmed's advice -Â I was able to prepare myself for technical interviews salary negotiations as well as just giving me a a confidence boost when I initially started at my new job and started feeling overwhelmed. Ahmed John and Quincy (John's teaching assistant) were the sole proprietors from this entire experience of getting me from noob to full-time salaried software developer. It is because of them that I personally felt that this program was worth it.It truly is a shame that the incredible work done by these men are overshadowed by the incompetencies and utter disorganization of the career services. I was under the impression (and given the impression) that we would be connected with a wide array of companies to hopefully be placed with at the conclusion of the program. \'Career services\' has consisted of students being told to apply for ten jobs a week and a Google sheet with seemingly Google'd job postings for software developers. A big number of the postings actually ask for candidates who are seeking a mid-level developerÂ with years of experience or a developer who has experience with frameworks that we were not taught at all in the program. Absolutely NOTHING like the connections they boasted about at the beginning of the program.In conclusion I am grateful for this program. Only for the fact that I have learned so much and have enjoyed every bit of learning during this experience. It has provided me with a skillset that will aid me for the rest of my life. At the end of the day my gripes are very specific and if I could go back I would absolutely choose the same path that I chose in the beginning of January. But hypothetically I would hope that I would possess the knowledge I have today about who in the program actually cares about each student's learning / overall success in life and who simply does not care and will feed you anything on a silver platter to get your check in the mail.Â ,849,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/16/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    Somerset ,,5,5,5,5,I was once like you: a boringly normalÂ humanÂ with a lame mostly administrative job and a random array of self-taught tech skills from HTML & CSS to the mostÂ rudimentary Ruby andÂ Java.Â AfterÂ enrollingÂ in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp all of that changed. IÂ moved up in my jobÂ I canÂ charge a significantly higher $$$/hourÂ rate forÂ freelance work andÂ I haven't even finished the program yet!After just a fewÂ months with RCB's instructors I could writeÂ fluent JavaScript modelÂ databases and I no longer have to searchÂ HTML and CSS attributes every five minutes whileÂ working on front-end projects.Â My career now has direction and for the first time in a long time it feels like my life has direction.Â In addition to its great instructorsÂ RCB also provides you with amazing career-focused guest speakers and an awesomeÂ career coach who will connect you with prospective jobs while equipping you with the skillsÂ to create stand-outÂ techÂ resumÃ©s.If you want a better futureÂ register today!,142,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/16/16,,    Somerset ,,5,5,5,5,I'd like to write a review about the April 2016 cohorts. I feel that this has been an amazing experience. The environment teachers and TA's are all very understanding and it feels like how college should have been. I have a Masters in Statistics but I wished I had more challenging programming courses in the tools used. After some experience as a Statistical analyst I thought I should go back to a program and learn applied programming (Rather than just theory)Â in a deeper level. I feel like I can apply my skills to a much broader field now. It is a pretty tough program but the environment makes a difference. It's a bootcamp so expect to be doing a lot of hard work. I am happy that it's not a traditonal lecture. I was always good at it but I never had enough hands on experience. I think compared to other schools 6 months is perfect yet just challenging enough.. Recently a couple of people have started getting jobs as well within 4 months!,174,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/5/16,,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,(For reference I was in the January 2016 cohort at New Brunswick). I have to say that I am so blessed that I applied was accepted and had the experience that I did. Â I will admit prior to starting the course I was scared. Â Not only scared but anxious that I would fall behind nervous that I didn't have the \'brain\' for this kind of work and regretfully filled with \'what ifs\' about my personal success in the course. Â But guess what? I did fall behind - and I got through it. Â I must say that though these past six months were incredibly challenging and through the tears (yes there were tears!) I came out more successful than I ever had expected after just six months. Â Rutgers Coding Bootcamp was an amazing experience. Â It's super difficult to learn new material especially material that you have never once seen or touched before (my background is in Clinical Counseling) and so you have all these anxieties that you won't succeed. But trust me you will. At RCB you have the MOST help and support not only by the teacher (I had Ahmed and I will say he is a fantastic teacher! I don't doubt that John the other teacher was great but I can only speak for Ahmed) but also by the TA's. I have never felt more sense of security and generosity than I did in this course. With also the help by the career team you can be sure you will be helped every step of the way. If you are stuck on a homework assignment or just need help or even if you're having a break down and need a pep talk you will have access to your teacher and TA's every single day (trust me I know from experience) and I can promise you you will come out the other side more successful confident and capable than you ever thought beforehand. If I could re-do these past six months I would do so in a heartbeat. Go RCB!Â ,340,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/2/16,,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,I was working at a dead-end job with a pointless degree. My life was starting to spiral out of control and IÂ didn't know what to do. Then I happened to stumble upon Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. The name Rutgers alone caught my eye since I graduated from Rutgers in 2013. The admission process was smooth and everyone was quick to respond during the intro stages.I came in with very little coding experience but from beginning to end the instructors and staff were there for me every step of the way. The program itself is intense meeting multiple times per week and dedicating time to homework all while working a full time job (definitely doable). The instructor (Ahmed) and TAs (Peter and Faisal) were extremely knowledgeable and helpful in every possible way. They take their time and make sure you do not fall behind and they definitely go that extra mile for their students.The curriculum is fine-tuned well thought out and will have you job ready in 6 monthsâ€™ time. From attending classes to spending countless hours on homework and projects (all while making friends in the processÂ =P ) Iâ€™m happy to say that my RCB experience was an amazing and successful one. I was able to land a position at a very reputable company right before graduation. Thank you to everyone at RCB for everything!Â ,224,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,7/26/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    Somerset ,,5,5,5,5,First of all. I would like to thank all of the instructors and teaching staff's hard work. It has been an amazing experience with Rutgers Booting Camp so far. I really like the instructor's teaching style. The whole program is very well designed. Not only on the teaching part but also mange to show us how fun and powful code can be in our real life.Â My major is not computer science. I started on my ownÂ in the begining and found it is reallyÂ something I am passionate about. Going back to school is the best choice I ever made. Becasue it is the only way for me to become more professional. Surounded by all the people who also share the same interests keeps me moving forward.Â Special thanks to Pavan my advisor and my instrutor Matt. It is really appreciated!Â RespectfullyChenÂ ,138,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,7/25/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,After graduating collegeÂ and working in some full-/part-time opportunities I reached a point where I wasn't sure what to do with my life. When I most needed it an advertisement for Rutgers Coding Bootcamp appeared on my Facebook feed one day. I applied and waited for a response not realizing that I had made one of the best decisions of my life.Â As a bootcamp this program is intensive. You meetÂ 3 times a week for 3-4 hours each class and will need to invest at least 20 hours a week to develop a firm understanding of a variety of technical concepts frameworks and languages. If you put in the time you will only boost your potential for success.Â The academic support in this program is second-to-none. The instructors (especially Ahmed Faisal and Peter)Â and staff all work tirelessly to help you reach your goals. The insight and the skills you develop from this program are invaluable not only to the Technology industry but also to life.,162,1
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,7/19/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,I am two weeks away from graduating from the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp and can honestly say that it has been a life changing experience. I entered the program nervous and doubtful of my ability to become a full stack software developer. Now six months laterÂ I am exiting the program with a valuable set of skills and confident that I will be successful in the tech industry. I highly recommend this program. The support of the administrationÂ the dedication and compassion of the professors are unlike anything I have ever experienced before.Â ,90,1
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,7/9/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,As a Rutgers alumni Â I can say that the quality of education at Rutgers Coding BootcampÂ exceeds the standards of education that I received as an undergrad. Â Between the high quality instructors withÂ a wealth of experience in the industry the extra support provided outside of class throughout the week and a curriculum that adapts to the constantly changing field of software development Â RCB is a program that I am proud to have been a part of.Â Beyond learning about software engineering principles RCB teaches valuable skillsÂ such as how to prepare a resume specifically tailored to jobs inÂ the IT industry how to market yourself on social media as well as how to ace the coding interview. Â Â The career advisors helped me seamlessly transition from a career in a completely different industry to one as a full time programmer. Â In addition the partnerships that the program has developedÂ with IT companies in the Tri-State area exceeeded my expectations. Â It was refreshingÂ to see the quality of employers at our demo day -Â I actually received an interview directly from this event and started my career as a software engineer two weeks later!Reflecting back it's hard to believe that only six months ago I didn't even know basic HTML & CSS. Â With RCB's help I was able to to learn the skills that I needed to become a full-stack developer and transition to a new career that I enjoy working in each day. Â ,236,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,6/26/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,I will be completing the RCB in about 4 weeks. The program is excellent and the staff has an enormous energy and ability to teach dense and detailed subject matter. Anyone considering the RCB must realize that it will take real dedication and a lot of hours but the payoff will be worth it. This curriculum can turn you into a full-stack developer in a mere 6 months. Try doing that on your own!Besides a dedicated staff and a well-organized curriculum the career services component and staff is second-to-none. They go the extra mile to make sure you are setting yourself up for success in the job market.All in all the experience has been very hard work with many many hours of learning on my own going to many classes and doing tons of coding for homework and group projects. But at the end there is tremendous satisfaction that the RCB delivered on what was promised.,156,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,11/16/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,4,5,3,5,"I attended the somerset campus and I'mÂ writing thisÂ reviewÂ a month after class has ended.CourseFirst off I reccommend attending FreeCodeCamp.com during the duration of this course to get the most out of it. This 6 month course will quickly go through the fundementals of programming to the moderately complex web development frameworks development environments package management version control quality control database managementÂ and many other important programming tools. Since the tech industry is a very fast paced world a 4 year degree in computer science could mean nothing by the time you get out you may have a steady foundation but with older programming languages or using outdated technology. Many languages don't last long and will phase out withinÂ a year or even less. This type of program avoidsÂ this problem by teaching you cutting edge languages in a short amount of time while also brushing over the fundementals. However there is a catch. If you don't put in aÂ Classrom ExperienceThis course was treated as if it was a college classroom with a similar grading system and strict attendance rules.Â You will not end up working for IBM by just taking this course with the minimum effort. That goes for college or anything you do in life as well though so this should be obvious.To be honest this is meant to be either:	Personal ExperienceI worked full time during the course with an intention of transitioning careers from IT to web development so my workload was full but I was still able to put in the extra time after class.Â I didn't have a greatÂ classroom experience at this course though. I have a medical conditionÂ that makes it difficult for me to socialize. Normally this isn't a problem butÂ I felt very ostracized here.Â The TAs and teacher wereÂ standoffish and rudeÂ with an exception of some good days scattered throughout. The instructor also didn't come off as well educated most of the timeÂ and fumbled through a lot of the course material. Google was my true teacher. However I did hear good things about other instructors so maybe I just didn't get lucky here.Job AssistanceThe career advisors are still sending me opportunites and were very helpful before during and afterÂ the course. They can be slow with responding during the course but that should be expected since theres like 3 of them and so many students.Â ConclusionMost people won't have the same struggle I had with the students instructor and TAs so I'll end with this: If you know the basicsÂ ofÂ computer programmingÂ plus willing to put in the time and effort outside of class then you will benefit from this course while possibly landing yourself a decent job and the $10KÂ cost is a good dealÂ for what they give you. For what it's worth I currently work full time.Â I'm very happy with the outcome despite the classroomÂ experience.",460,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,11/10/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,3,2,2,1,SUMMERYThis is a great course for meeting like-minded students interested in web development and building a strong foundation. If youâ€™re main goal is to get set up with a job (by the bootcamp)Â after course completion you will be disappointed. Â Â THE GOODThe instructors and TAs are knowledgeable and willing to help you when you get stuckThe instructors & career services will give you advice on how to make yourself marketable make an appealing portfolio and how to answer common interview questions.THE BADYou will need at least 20+ hours of outside work per week to understand the material as you go through the course. This isnâ€™t necessarily a bad thing but they tell you that you will only need 10 hours per week. That is simply untrue even for the brightest students.Hiring partners are virtually non-existent. Despite what they will keep telling you there is not a large group of employers waiting to hire you when you finish.Career services has input on the curriculum. This sounds like a good idea until they try to teach you three programming languages in 10 hours of class time and expect you to be confident enough to put it on your resume.Â THE UGLYThe instructor we had might be the most unprofessional individual I have ever met. He told us he was there because he got fired from his previous job and it was obvious why.The curriculum director and those assisting him have little regard for theÂ quality of the material they push out.The post bootcamp job assistance wasÂ atrocious.

RUTGERS,TRILOGY,11/4/16,,,,5,5,5,5,I graduated from Rutgers Coding Bootcamp a while ago and have settled into my new life as a junior developer for a few months now. Â  Â As a woman changing careers I knew the experience would be a big change for me. Â I also had to workÂ full time during this course.Both the instructors and my classmates were great; offering support both during and after class. It really made a difference on those days I needed a few extra pointers. Â At first I was a bit overwhelmed to be honest. The work load is high and some people in my class had strong coding experience. But I Â kept my focus throughout the class and believed it could be done.So Â it took a while for me to get comfortable with the material and pace. Be prepared to spend many hours outside of class studying reviewing and learning on your own. Â I'd love to say I got a job the week after class. It didn't happen. Â It took me almost 6 weeks. Like anything in life to get the help you need; you need to be proactive. I kept calling and emailing the support team; asking for advice and help throughout my job search.I also kept working on my projects; developing them further. Â This really turned out to make a big difference in finding a job. To that end I really need to give a shortout to my instructor. Amazing person; even if I felt I probably was annoying at times; he always provided support and great coding advice.I was lucky to find a great job with a tech startupÂ that also leveraged upon my previous career experience.Â I'd recommend RCB to anyone. But Â be prepared to invest the time and energy required for success; just like anything in life.Â ,295,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,11/3/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,1,1,1,1,Do yourself a favor and do some research before agreeing to enroll in this program. I graduated about two weeeks ago and only recently found spot-on reviews from students who went through the program before I did. From the beginning it's shameless lying and overall indecency from the student success department. The instructors were great but it is absolutely embarrassing how manipulated I was looking back especially by the student success manager who never replied to any of my concerns or messages.Â If you're interested in this program and find this post I implore you to do your research before agreeing to anything especially not some measly $500 'scholarship',108,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,10/28/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    Somerset ,,1,1,1,1,Save your timer and money if you dont have prior experience. I graduated even though I did not Â learn anything more than HTML CSS and BOOTSTRAP which was pretty easy. Career day was a waste becuase only 3 employers showed up and wanted people who really know what they were doing. Alot of students other than my self did not learn much because the course is rushed and the \'teacher\' is not very experienced.Â Save your time and money.,78,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/23/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,1,1,1,1,This so called bootcamp is such a dissapoitment. I should have done my research before starting. This school only has about 20 reviews when other schools have thousands of reviews which are all mostly positive. Evertything that was thought was thought from google. When I asked where the restroom was they told me to google it. That is their answer to everything. No books are provided and the instructors and assitants dont know much about coding. The whole course should be re evaluated.Â Save your time and money go else where or teach your self. Please dont make the same mistake I made.The student success manager really needs to be trained better or she should find a new job. She is the main reason why the course is runned the way it is.Â What a dissapointment. I cant understand how they have any positive reviews.,143,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/19/16,,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,1,Â I graduated from Rutgers Coding Bootcamp in July and overall it was a great experience. The program moves pretty quickly so you must be ready to put in the hard work. The instructors and teaching assistants definitely made you feel like family.I can not say the same for the career development and studentÂ success team. There were countless times where many students tried to get in contact with Â people who are part of student success and did not get a response for weeks. I understand that there is a lot going on but not hearing back for weeks is unacceptable.Career services held a couple workshops to help people get prepared for the job market. We only had one mock interview with very limited feedback from career services. At the end of the program they hosted a Demo day where students can showcase their portfolios to recruiters. Many of us noticed that the number of partnerships that they told us they had at the beginning of the programÂ and the number of that showed up were not remotely close. I also noticed a lot of favoritism during demo day. Instructors were pointing recruiters in their favorite students direction. Many of us stood there with less than a handful of recruiters stopping by to see our work. We were all told to print 100 copies but handed out less than 20.This program will greatly broaden your coding knowledge and you will come out of it with tools that will help you succeed in web development. On the other hand don't rely on career services to find you a job; work hard and find one on your own.,273,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/16/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,1,1,1,1,The name is Rutgers but it is really a third party who runs the school. The instructors and Tas arent much help they tell you to google everything. Save your money and go to another school. 70% of the time they dont get through theÂ lesson plans. The classes are part time but you have to study full time to be successfull. I would not recommend this course to my worst enemy.Â ,71,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/16/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,4,5,4,I graduated about 3 weeks ago and what I have seen that putting the time the sweat and the effort does pay off. It is not easy to be good at something if you do the basic and minimum work. The program is intensive and that is to be expected the instructors know the subject and have worked in the field which helps a lot when it comes to looking at problems not only from a coding stand point but from a real enviorment. I would recommend the bootcamp.Â ,89,0

UCF ORLANDO,TRILOGY,9/1/17,    Full Stack Flex - Full Time ,    Orlando , LinkedIn,5,5,5,5,I recently graduated the UCF Coding Boot Camp just this past May and I must say that it is a challenge. Material came in waves and it's basically learning something new every single day. The way I described it to friends when they asked was \'You know how in college there are prerequisite intro classes you have to take and pass for a few semesters in your freshman and sophomore years before you go onto the core classes in your junior and senior year? This is basically all the core hard classes almost every day\' However because it is challenging it is very rewarding.Â The instructional staff of Bob Josh and Justin were very engaging and they'll do what they can to help students understand and succeed. Ricky is also very helpful if any student needs extra help he'll help them get in touch with central tutoring to combat the material that may seem extra difficult. One of their goals is to teach you how to learn this specific material.Â Off the top of the head the material includes HTML CSS Bootstrap JavaScript jQuery Github Node MongoDB Mongoose MySQL PHP React Json Packages APIs and Laravel.Â There are many ways to succeed and you have to remember that everyone from your fellow classmates to the instructional staff wants to see you succeed so no matter how much you feel like you might be drowning in the material reach out because there is always support around. You don't feel like you're left there on an island by yourself.Â You will get out of it as much as you put into it. Even though the material was tough I personally like the aspect of self reliance. The instructional staff will you put you in a position where you might have to find things on your own. They're not doing that to be bad guys. They're doing it so that you yourself can understand why something is right or why something is wrong.Â If you were just given the answer it'd rob you of that moment when you do discover the appropriate answer. I don't want to say \'right\' answer because with a lot of the material there are more than one way to solve something and it just depends on how you. Even after the class is over it is up to you to look for and apply for your next career as well as continuing to work at the material to get even better. They will introduce the material and give you the tools and it is up to you to use them. You have to be the one to put most of the hours in and if you do you will have a way better chance to succeed. There's only so much support that they can give you to where you have to do the rest.The full time program is three months but those three months blew by. There is so much work to be done and material to be learned that it'll go by quick. I'll never forget it. I'll have life long friends because of this program. It is certainly an awesome experience.Â ,520,0
UCF ORLANDO,TRILOGY,9/1/17,    Full Stack Flex - Full Time ,    Orlando , LinkedIn,4,3,5,0,I had a great experience at the bootcamp. I found the staff to be very knowledgeable of theÂ curriculum provided as well as vested in having the students learn how to do things properly.Â I already had a job in a related field before the bootcamp however had I not I feel that I would have been prepared to take on an entry level web developer position after this course.Â You definitely get what you put in to a course like this and I felt the cost was justified.

UCF ORLANDO,TRILOGY,9/1/17,    Full Stack Flex - Full Time ,    Orlando , GitHub,5,5,5,5,I came into the programÂ with no coding experience. Â I was unable to program even the simpliest website. Â As a Â graduate of UCF Coding Bootcamp I am now able produce complicated full stack websites. Â The educational staff is top-notch. Â Bob JoshÂ Justin and Ricky areÂ very knowledgable and helpful. Â TheyÂ did an excellent job of teaching the material and assisting students to futher their understandingÂ ofÂ complex concepts. They also teach you how to learn and how to think of the solution yoursellf. Â I think that is one of the most valuable lessons teachers can give students. Â The course material covered a lot of different languages libraries and databases. Â We were immersed in HTML CSS JavaScriptJQueryÂ MySQL MongoDB React and Express just to name a few. Â The UCF Coding Bootcamp is challenging especially for those coming in with no experience. Â Like anyÂ life changing undertakings it is a lot of hard work. Â If you are willing to put in the work and learn the skills needed for the next phase of your life you will be greatly rewarded. Â While you are learning these new skills the career services staff is helping you to market yourself and improve your online presence. Â Jessica and Alexis provided great insightÂ and suggestions. Â Overall I think this is a great program. Â I recommend it to anyone looking to learn news skils or change the direction of their professional life.,225,1
UCF ORLANDO,TRILOGY,9/1/17,    Full Stack Flex - Part Time ,    Orlando , GitHub,5,5,5,5,If you're ready to change your life and work REALLY hard UCF Coding Bootcamp is for you. Â I attended an Orlando part-time cohort for 6 months - and it was intense (but awesome!). Â The curriculum is fast-paced and non-stop. Â My instructor (Bob) was very intelligent and great at explaining concepts and applications in a way we could follow and apply to in-class activities and homework. Â While his pace could be very fastÂ and his Boston accent was horrible (just kidding) I felt that he really prepared our class for the fast-paced nature of the industry andÂ he shared with us knowledge beyond the level of the curriculum - about code frameworks andÂ languages software and technologies that could propel us forward as developers and real-world application of the tools we were learning. Â OurÂ TA's (JohnÂ Ronny & Justin)Â were excellent and made themselves available regularly outside of class (almost weekly held study group open and available for everyone). Sometimes the pace of in-class instruction can be very fast and in order to get the entirety of the lesson the instructor(s) had to keep moving and the TAs would always stop and assist on the side if you truly couldn't keep following along as well as being consistently ready and willing to assist via Slack (messaging app) outside of class hours. Â As the class came to an close I felt that we would have benefited from the curriculum being a bit more balanced. Â Of course with most students coming into the course with no prior coding knowledge we required sufficient time to devote to the basics (HTML CSS Javascript) but I felt that we would have benefited from spending more time onÂ the higher-level frameworks (React PHP/Laravel) - as these are the skills truly necessary to land a Junior Developer role. Â That being said I was lucky enough to land a great job as a PHP developer before the class came to a close. Â I didn't use much of the post-course career services but they are very active offering weekly webinars and are consistently availble to assist my fellow classmates in landing a job (as of today we are just over 1 month outside of graduation). Â All in all there is no way I could have absorbed the amount of knowledge I did through this course in 6 months especially if I was trying to learn on my own. Â This course was life changing for me - I've completely transformed my career and found what I believe my brain is supposed to be doing.TLDR; Take the course but only if you're ready to work intensely hard.,428,2
UCF ORLANDO,TRILOGY,8/31/17,    Full Stack Flex - Full Time ,    Orlando , GitHub,5,5,5,5,Â Coming from someone who didn't have any tech experience prior to the course I would recommend this program to those who are passionate about the industry and willing to work hard to achieve their goals. I will say the curriculum certainly demands your full attention if you are new to the tech environment. I worked countless hours to grasp particular concepts and absolutely exceeded my own expectations in reference to myÂ capabilities and what I anticipated the course to provide. My particular instructor was extremely knowledable and dedicated to our cohorts learning process. I had guidance when I needed it and was able to teach myself how to learn without having to approach others to help me with a solution. At my demo day at the end of the course I prepared my best and recieved plenty of attention from the employers who attended which precipitated into several interviews. Career services was also able to line up an interview for me which lead to an internship right when the course ended. Overall this was one of the best experiences I've had in my lifetime and I've also made some lifelong friends in the process. Thank you UCF Coding Bootcamp for jump starting my new career!,204,0
UCF ORLANDO,TRILOGY,8/28/17,    Full Stack Flex - Full Time ,    Orlando , LinkedIn,5,5,5,4,I graduated from the first full-time course at the UCF Coding Bootcamp and it was the best decision of my life. Everyone says you get out of it what you put in and that couldn't be more true. This course is designed for people like me who came in with no experience all the way up to computer science graduates. It teaches you the fundamentals that you need to become a web developer and it gives you the resources and skills you need to keep learning.Â Being the first full-time cohort had its cons the holidays we had took us a little off course and so did group projects. But the instructional staff didnâ€™t let that hold them back. They constantly did their best to make sure we learned everything we needed to and took all of our feedback. They took weekly reviews on BootcampSpot seriously and made changes that made sure everyone got the most out of this experience.The best part of this bootcamp was definitely the instructional staff. I had what I call the \'dream team\' aka Bob Josh Justin and Ricky. They genuinely cared about each one of us. Josh would to stay after and help us out whether it was going back over fundamentals or going over homework solutions. Justin is an amazing example of a hard worker. He graduated the bootcamp right before mine and you could tell how much he loved coding. Heâ€™s a Javascript and git master which was super helpful to have. Bob was the best instructor I couldâ€™ve got. Going through an intense bootcamp like this it was so refreshing to have someone like him not only teach us but be supportive and care. Learning new coding languages is hard but his teaching style is the best Ive ever experienced. Him and his humor truly made my bootcamp experience.Another amazing part of the bootcamp wasÂ Central Support. In the full-time bootcamp we got 2 tutoring sessions a week. Jared was an amazing tutor and having that extra support was incredible. Central Support also gives you the opportunity to become a tutor which I did a few days after I graduated! The opportunities you get with this bootcamp are second to none!I got an offer letter to join a company 2 weeks after I graduated and am so grateful to everyone that helped me make this happen. I would definitely do it again!,399,1
UCF ORLANDO,TRILOGY,8/11/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Fort Lauderdale , GitHub,5,5,5,5,As a recent graduate I'm very pleased and confident I've acquired marketable skills. I'm currently working with my career counselor who is helping me connect with recruiters and potential employers.Â My pre-class expectations were threefold: 1) to be presented with a curriculum that would teach me how to code a web serverÂ toÂ deliver interactive content; 2) to access professional developers as instructors who could teach coding troubleshoot code and describe real-world professional web development practices and experience; and 3) to leverage tuition financingÂ and career services through the UCF organization. The experienceÂ exceeded my expectations on all counts. For my final project using a CRNA skeleton I deployed a MERN stack web application that includes browser and mobile (native) elements.Â The course starts with web fundamentals so it's conceivable a student could begin withÂ zero prior experience but I had some non-professional programming experience and found it quite challenging. It was like having a second full time job. To maximize success you must read documentationÂ and writeÂ code every day from day one and ask for help when you need it.Â Was it perfect? Nothing is but the product is as described and the people were responsive to any issues that arose.Â The classroomÂ staff -- instructors TA's success manager and career counselor -- all very accessible and clearly worked hard to deliver a quality product. Upper level managers visited classes fairly frequently. Again I'm very pleased with my decision to enroll.,231,0
UCF ORLANDO,TRILOGY,6/21/17,    Full Stack Flex - Part Time ,    Orlando , LinkedIn,5,5,5,5,I entered the UCF Coding Bootcamp with what I would say a beginner to intermediate level of coding experience focusing around languages of C/C++/Java and a hint HTML/CSS. I stumbled on the course advertisement online while looking for resources to learn/teach myself JavaScript at home. After some research on Coding Boot camps in general I decided to go make the leap and apply to UCFs Bootcamp. Upon applying I was given a brief questionnaire that tested problem solving and linear thinking abilities along with a phone interview that covered personality and background and some general questions on why I was interested in attending. I like that the camp took the time to interview and sort their applicants to make sure they were taking in people in they wanted.This reflected in class well as fellow class mates came from all types of professional backgrounds and reasons to be attending. But all shared a drive to be there and seemed genuinely interested in becoming a full stack web developer either it be for a total career change or just general interest and to expand their current skillset. The camp is organized to force collaboration threw slack chats and in the classroom. This was honestly tough for a shy person like myself but goes with the culture they create and you fall into it willing or not but most definitely for the better.The pace of the course is relatively fast but will ebb and flow based on how the class is absorbing the content allowing classmates that are confused on a topic to get help from classmates or TAâ€™s around them that are getting the concepts. This cycles threw out the course and a reason to be social and connect/help others and creates the group learning environment. I attended the Orlando West Valencia Campus and had what I thought to be an amazing Instructor and Taâ€™s. If you sign up for this course I advise you to take it with Bob Dwight or John. Bob was my instructor for this I could not have been happier with him or the TAâ€™s Dwight and John. Whom were not only great personalities to have in the class but where always willing to help out and knew their stuff.The course encourages group work on the weekly assignments given to help grasp the content. The course has 2 main group projects of which our group stayed together for each and was really enjoyable but you are free to shuffle groups as you please within a max group size constraint. For projects you are given a list of technologies you must use and are free to decide on what to create as a team and then present them in a combined two class meeting on Saturdays. This makes the projects great and there were some amazing ideas/apps that came from both classes and allowed us to use what we just learned the 2-3 weeks prior to create something of our own and not just crank out â€œhomeworkâ€ù assignments. The group project aspect was probably my favorite feature of the camp.There is a big final project which leads to the end of the course and â€œDemo Dayâ€ù. This project can be done in a group or alone. Most chose to take on this project alone as presenting on Demo Day is a great opportunity the camp creates in which you present your final project to prospecting employers or other tech industry professionals and can lead to some great connections and job opportunities. Our demo day I think had about 94 attending employers.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Post-graduation support was great. You are assigned a career advisor to help you land a job. Zach who was mine literally handed me I think 2 interviews of which I did absolutely nothing for all I did was set the time to go in. The continued support and feedback you get from their advisory team is invaluable in my eyes.I was offered and accepted a job for a local company here in Orlando who is not in the camps network and have been happily titled a \'Jr. PHP Developer\' for a couple weeks now andÂ using the full stack day to day.Â  I am also doing contract work for a company here in Orlando the camp put me in direct connection with. I cannot thank the UCF Coding Bootcamp and staff enough for their help and support for making a dream of mine come true.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ,737,0
UCF ORLANDO,TRILOGY,6/7/17,    Full Stack Flex - Part Time ,    Orlando , LinkedIn,5,5,5,4,Prior to enrolling in the UCF Web Dev Boot Camp I had read a couple of reviews here on Course Report that helped me with the decision to sign up. Now that Iâ€™ve completed the course here are my thoughts.I was in the September 2016 cohort that finished up a couple of months ago. The program is 24 weeks of instruction but mine took longer chronologically because of winter break and a few other holidays in the middle. My particular class met Mon/Wed 6:30-9:30pm then we joined up with a concurrently running cohort for a combined Sat 10am-2pm session. A new topic was introduced weekly that we would slowly build on over the course of the 3 classes. The instructor would lecture for a while then we would be given activities to complete to reinforce the learning. There was also a weekly major homework assignment with the idea being to use it to build out our portfolio. In addition there were also three major projects along the way in which we had freedom to come up with an idea plan it out execute it then finally present it formally - all to practice what we might face in our future careers.For anyone thinking about signing up I would say make absolutely sure youâ€™re willing to put in some hard work and some long hours. They tell you that you should plan to put in 15-20 hours outside of class and I would say thatâ€™s more like a minimum. I found I was often putting in closer to 20-30 hours between going over class material re-doing class activities completing homework researching more deeply and so on. The pace is also relentless. You canâ€™t ease up because if you decide to mentally check out for a week itâ€™s extremely difficult to catch up again. However life happens people get sick etc. so they tried to account for that by recording the class lectures and offering 1-on-1 sessions with the instructors to get caught up again.The instructor we started with Sean was excellent. He really knew how to break down difficult concepts and despite clearly being very knowledgeable and experienced was able to speak at the level of those of us with no prior experience. Half way through the course we had a change of instructors which was a bit disruptive but the new instructor Bob was also excellent. The other person I want to really give kudos to was the student success manager Ricky who was beyond awesome. He was always there to help out anytime any issues came up whether personal or class related. There were also a couple of TAs around in each class and they were always ready to help too as needed.The one place where the program did trip up was when it came to Career Services. We were told there would be many speakers from the industry who would be brought in to talk that weâ€™d be introduced to employer partners that we would go on tours to potential employers that there would be personalized coaching for facing interviews later etc. The person in charge of career services for our cohort got promoted to a different position soon after we began and they never had a proper replacement through the running of the boot camp. For this reason while we did get some cursory help it wasnâ€™t quite what was promised. (I know this was unique to my cohort because Iâ€™m now working as a part time teaching assistant in the subsequent cohort and can see theyâ€™re getting far superior career guidance already.) However after course completion they do have another career services division that takes over and Iâ€™m now working with them to find a good position. Theyâ€™ve helped fine tune my LinkedIn profile clean up my GitHub repositories critiqued my portfolio site and more. As with the class work for this career work phase I still have to put in my efforts too by reviewing job listings applying going to meetups to network etc.Overall my experience was a good one. If I had to do it over yes I would still sign up. As others have said in their reviews you get out of it what you put into it. They provide you the tools and the instruction and the support but you have to do the work. If youâ€™re willing to I see no reason why anyone canâ€™t be successful.,736,0
UCF ORLANDO,TRILOGY,4/6/17,    Full Stack Flex - Part Time ,    Orlando , LinkedIn,5,5,5,5,I came into this program with some self taught web development experience and was making some decent headway going that route. I had always been skeptical of programming bootcamps this place changed my mind. If you asked me 6 months ago if I could build what I am able to build now I would have told you are crazy.You will get out what you put into this course I definietly had alot more time than other students in my class but the staff was extermely accommodating to that fact even when I asked questions on topics we hadn't covered it.Â If your brand new to web development or someone looking to improve their skills and hesitating signing up for this course my suggestion to you is ask yourself are you willing to put in the time? If so sign up!,139,0
UCF ORLANDO,TRILOGY,1/15/17,    Full Stack Flex - Part Time ,    Orlando , LinkedIn,5,5,5,5,Â I started the UCF Coding Bootcamp with little to no prior coding experience. The application process is a little intimidating. It's not just \'you can pay you're in\'. You have to go through a phone interview where they assess your cognitive skills. You also take an assessment online.Â Each class has 30 students with 1 teacher and 2 TAs. You meet two days a week (either Monday and Wednesday or Tuesday and Thursday) and you also have a Saturday morning class in which you join another 30 student class. Since you are spending 3 days a week with your classmates you very quickly become family.The Bootcamp encourages tight knit relationships - providing your class with a slack channel requiring two group projects and giving you some of the coolest TAs to bounce ideas off of and receive feedback from.As far as the teachers go each teacher has their own teaching style with everyone following the same lesson plan class activities and homework assignments. Whats awesome about the boot camp is they film the classes from both MW and Tu/Th so if you find you arent understanding something you can easily watch the same lesson again taught by a different person.Overall other than coding - the Boot Camp emphasizes the lifestyle of a coder. We got to take field trips to technology companies and see what their day to day was like. Most Saturdays we had guest speakers - most of them being influential people in the Orlando Tech Industry who might potentially be future employers. We were encouraged to go to MeetUps do Google Hangouts and put ourselves into the job market.As far as finding a job the Boot Camp helps you with your resume linkedIn profile GitHub Repo and portfolio. As a part of your graduation they host a Demo Day where you show off a final project of your choice to potential employers.Upon finishing they help get you job interviews with their employer partners in exchange for applying to at least 10 jobs a week. Before I graduated I was already offered 2 freelance positions and look forward to seeing where the future takes me!Â If you are considering a Full Stack Web Development course and want to be surrounded by serious like-minded people who care about your goals and career path definitely do this boot camp!Â ,387,0
UCF ORLANDO,TRILOGY,9/1/17,    Full Stack Flex - Full Time ,    Orlando ,,3,5,5,1,If all you are looking for is a solid base knowledge of full stack development I have nothing but good things to say for the instructors and TAs of this program.

They encouraged you to learn and pushed you further than you thought you could go. A wonderful experience.,79,0

UCF ORLANDO,TRILOGY,9/1/17,    Full Stack Flex - Full Time ,    Orlando ,,5,5,5,4,I recently graduated from the UCF full stack coding boot camp in August. This boot camp literally changed my life I had no coding experience before I attended this camp and was very nervous coming in. Reading the curriculum was very nerve wracking for me as I had no clue what most of these terms and \'languages\' were. But going in to the first day my AMAZINGÂ instructor Bob and his TAs assured us all that we are in this together and will learn step by step. They make sure nobody gets left behind but I do want to say one thing about getting the most out of this program. The TAs can only do so much for you and can not always be right by your side for each assignmentÂ and homework. You have to put in the extra time and work outside of class. You can not just go home and start watching tv and forget about programming. You have to go home do more research and practice practice practice. If you do that throughout the camp you will come out as one of the top developers in your class and be fully job ready for the real world. It is not an easy course but it is not impossible either it is an amazing opportunity that I would recommend to anybody interested in the tech industry.,227,1
UCF ORLANDO,TRILOGY,9/1/17,,    Orlando ,,5,5,5,5,I recently graduated from the UCF Full Stack Coding Bootcamp in Aug. 2017. Â I took one programming class in college 15 years prior but never pursued it much after that. Â I researched all the different options before signing up and most of the othersÂ have gone out of business since then and theÂ reason for that is as follows:Â  From the first day to the last day we were full steam ahead. Â We covered everything associated with full stack development. Â Within a couple weeks I knew I was in over my head and asked for help. Â The T.A.s the instructor and even the UCF Coordinator swooped in and got me set up with a tutor who was another student in a different program who was further ahead than us. Â This is what made all the difference. Â They really did want to see me succeed and help out where they could. Â They checked in regularly and helped me focus on what I needed to improve. Â I couldn't be happier with the experience and I do think it was worthwhile. Â They have a really good partnership with the university and plenty of people rooting for your success. Â Now its up to me to put it work. Â In terms of what this bootcamp can offer - they go over everything from HTML CSS JavaScript NodeJS React PHP MySQL MongoDB and a few others. Â If I could recommend one thing it would be to come in humble and ready to learn because the amount of information can be very overwhelming but with a little effort and asking for help this could really change your life for the better. Â Put in the time and use every resource they offer.,282,1

UCF ORLANDO,TRILOGY,8/15/17,    Full Stack Flex - Full Time ,    Orlando ,,5,4,5,5,I was 25 already in a dead end job doing something I did not care about. I wanted a change and have always been very into the idea of programming as a profession and have tried to teach my self it countless times in the past. this Bootcamp came at the right time in my life. with them having multiple locations and times it made it easy to find one that fit my schedule. Once I was in I was hooked. both the professors I delt with on a weekly basis Dan and Bob were better than I would ever of hopedÂ for. They truely have a passion not only for programming but sharing their knowledge with others.Now it being called a Boot Camp made me prepare for the worst. Even though we met 3 times a week there is enough work to keep you busy day and night for the whole week and made it fit the Boot Camp name.Â There is an extensive amount of support for learning the challenging topics they cover in the short amount of 6 months. there were a total of 4 TA's 2 professors 2 administrative helpers(to answer any job/career finacial questions you had) all of them available just about 24/7. Always online to chat and each Friday they would have an open google hangout for about 2 hours even if no one showed up just to be available to dive into your code and help you debug any issues you are having.Â The languages that were taught are the languages that I now see day to day working in the industry They even made changes in what languages to teach as they saw the interest of the classÂ shift. no one wanted to learn Java in my class so they switched it out with more PHP or angular if we wanted to learn that. All tools we used to communicate and submit our work are the tools used in the industry today to communicate and share work.Â Now this class only walks you through the first few languages (HTMLCSS and some Javascript) and after that really push you to learn how to research and find resources on your own but if you ever get stuck they were more than happy to take all the time you need to help youÂ get through it.Â when I left that class I not only got a great understanding ofÂ the main languages used today but also coding basics that help me adapt and figure out other languages on my own. I have an extensive portfolio and very detailed and connected LinkedIn profile. I also am still connected with the students TA's and Professors of my class and have worked with them on projects. This class is exactly what I needed when I needed it.Â They ended the class with a Demo day where they invited people from the industry to come look at our projects we had to share. I ended up picking up a programming job on the side while going through the class and the professors let me make that my Final Project and gave me great advice of working on client work. they helped me bid out jobs and come up with a good estimate of how long it would take to make it. At Demo Day I was given about a dozen business cards and 2 job offers.DISCLAIMER! if you want this to be a cheap college alternative this is not the class for you! this class is an intensive coding BOOT CAMP there were nights I would go home and be so mentally exausted by the amout of learning and critical thinking that is involved. If you are expecting to be spoon fed you will waste your money and everyones time.,622,0
UCF ORLANDO,TRILOGY,6/6/17,,    Orlando ,,1,1,1,1,I attended this last year for one of the sessions at the Orlando campus. It was a horrible experience. They do a tremendous job marketing this as a life changing experience for those with little to no coding experience but realistically it's a disaster if you have no previous coding experience.I had signed for one of the courses that had classes on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons along with Saturday morning with an instructor (Bob) and it was a fiasco. He has no previous teaching experience so he's not a very good instructor. He knows how to code but he doesn't know how to teach to code.The TA's weren't that helpful as there's a ton of students and there's only a handful of TA's (about 2-3 max per course).The worst part is that they'll give you excercise and expect you to learn in 5 minutes before they continue along and if you get lost then hey you get lost. It doesn't matter to them as they already have your $8000 (if you sign up early) or $9500 if you sign up later.There were people in class with previous coding backgrounds so they knew a lot so the instructor would pace the class around them which as a mess for those of us without that much previous experience.I got visibly frustrated a lot and one of the instructor (Bob) one day noticed and told me if I felt uncomfortable to get up and go home if I wanted to as it was only going to get harder... Really?!?! That's the best advice you can give someone who's paid their hard earned money to attend this disaster?I continually kept in contact with the organizer (Ricky Cuellar) as my reviews of the course continued being negative. Once I informed him I wouldn't be attending anymore he just sent me the links to the YouTube videos with the excercises and I never heard back from them again plus I couldn't get a refund as I had already stayed a month hoping I could catch along but it was impossible the mess they had already made.Overall one of the worst experiences of my life. I totally regret handing over $9K of my hard earned money to these people. Avoid at all cost.,376,1

UCF ORLANDO,TRILOGY,9/1/16,    Full Stack Flex - Part Time ,    Orlando ,,5,5,5,5,I enrolled in the inaugural class of the UCF Boot Camp. It has been the best school experience that I have ever had. I am very proud of what I have accomplished in this boot camp but I would not have been able to do it in this short of a time without the support of my teachers TA's and support staff. This boot camp is not easy but it does give you everything that you need to get a great start to a career as a Full Stack developer. UCF has hired the best developers to teach this class they have an amazing curriculum and they give you the tools that you need to succeed. Any time that you have a question you can either ask it on Slack or you can meet with the TA's before or after class to get it figured out.Â The development of the curriculum is really top notch they have it down to a science this is what you need to know in order to get a job as a developer today. Of course you don't learn everything that there is to know this is a 6 month course after all but once you get through it you will know where to find the answers and how to it out on your own.Â All of the staff have so much enthusiasm and help you get through and to realize how much you have accomplished. Throughout the boot camp you will develop applications that you can use for your portfolio you will work in teams and on your own making applications that will look amazing and then the Career Director will work with you one on one to help you make a plan for your next step and build a resume enhance your linkedin and how to really show off your portfolio.Â The best advice I have for future students in this boot camp is to use all of the services that they provide you have paid for use the 1-on-1's with the TA's for help understanding concepts show up early and work with your fellow students. This boot camp may seem like it will take a long time but trust me time flies and you will be graduating before you know it.,376,0

UCLA,TRILOGY,9/1/17,    Full Stack Flex - Part Time ,    Los Angeles , LinkedIn,4,4,5,2,"If you're serious about becoming a job-ready web developer and you're not just going on a whim the Coding Boot Camp at UCLA Extension is worth the money. You seeÂ web development is no joke. You can't BS your way through coding; you either learnÂ and work the long hours to truly master the concepts or you don't...Â Even with some programming experience under my belt I struggled tremendously.I took the part-time version of this course (~20 hours per week) but I imagine the full-time one would be similar in its approach and results just much more intensive. For half the course I had a full-time job and during the second half I committed myself fully to the course.Here are the pros the vital benefits of the boot camp:	I attribute what I know as a developer to this program and if I had to learn what I learned on my own with no assistance I imagine it would have taken much longer (honestly a year or more). The guiding nature of this program brings you tricks tips and best practices which are small individually but over the length of the course they add up to make you a strong and well-rounded junior developer.Also please take the course seriously. It will be so easy to slack off. Imagine if you were NOT paying attention in the first few weeks; because the concepts build on each other you basically have to do some extreme catch-upÂ OR you lose all the value you can get out of the program due to your stupidity.

The experience was awesome I got to meet other classmate that came from different background but we all want to learn and have the same goal. I did recieve a lot of support from the instructorÂ tutors and classmate. To current and future student you need to put in a lot of effort into reviewing in class materials and homework. You need to have time management in juggling reviewing and homework also I would recommend codewars to gain advancement in programming. Omar is a fantastic teacher he's really hand on and engaging. He will goes the extra mile in explaining the lesson and checking in with you to make sure you are notÂ struggling in class. I would definitely take his class again if I can.Â Overall its a great course and a good learning experience.Â ,162,0
UCLA,TRILOGY,8/13/17,    Full Stack Flex - Part Time ,    Los Angeles , LinkedIn,5,5,5,5,I found this course in a time in my life when I was in a very tough place and needed to grow. And when I looked into the program itÂ became the right decision more and more. I came into the course with no knowledge of software engineering but came out of the course feeling so confident and powerful. You have to make this course work for you! What did you come here wanting to accomplish? Who do you want to become? How do you want to grow? Just because you sign up don't think that's the end. This course is about hard work and dedication. It's about consistently going out there and building those dreams you came in wanting to accomplish. If you're ready to change your life yourself and your career make the commitment and take this course. The instructors are great the staff is dedicated and everything that you need to achieve your goals is provided. The only thing needed is heart and you'll make it happen.Â ,169,1
UCLA,TRILOGY,7/31/17,    Full Stack Flex - Full Time ,    Los Angeles , LinkedIn,5,5,5,5,I am so happy I took this course. I had always had an interest in coding and web design but was somewhat scared to take the leap into it. I remember starting the class nervous and worried â€” since my background was in marketing/writing. However I was quickly met with challenges and a vast amount of support from the team at the coding bootcamp.One of the biggest challenges for me was breaking code and making mistakes. I was scared of mistakes but I quickly learned to be comfortable with making mistakes and ultimately learning so much in such a short amount of time because of my new comfort and the support of the TAâ€™s and instructor. No matter how mistakes I made I was always met with encouragement and support.This program is great for those who want to continue working full-time. I would say the six month program is one of the few coding bootcamps that you can do while continuing to work. The support of the both the instructor and the staff helped me transition from my marketing manager position at work into a junior web developer.,188,0
UCLA,TRILOGY,7/13/17,,    Los Angeles , GitHub,5,5,5,5,The Coding Bootcamp was one of the most intense yet amazing experience I've had so far in both my education and working career. The entire faculty has been very supportive and have provided students with enough help to be successful in class.Coming in with very little experience with programming this program has definitely increased my knowledge and enabled me to create simple websites to very functional applications. As a designer It enabled me to access different realms of advancement and has truly increased my expertise making me a more valueble candidate for employers.Please take note however it's a Bootcamp you better be ready to put in the work or you're going to get your butt kicked.,116,0
UCLA,TRILOGY,7/6/17,,    Los Angeles , LinkedIn,5,5,5,5,This full stack web developer bootcamp is the best decision i had made for my career. I was planning to attainÂ grad school; but then choose this bootcamp instead to learn new technology. I have a bachelors degree in computer engineering even though i didnt know how to properly make a full stack application. This course taught me how to make a full stack web application using all the new technology (MERN stack) and it enabled me to quickly grasp other relevant important technologies like MEAN stack as they are one and the other. The instructor tutors and career support is phenomenal; they always respond to my pings/queries in less than an hour when i am not in class.Â InstructorÂ (Omar Patel)Â was extemenly helpful and have a tendency toÂ explainÂ things in simple termsterms that we can easily understandÂ and hard toÂ forget. Tutors were also very helpful in teaching and solving queries. I mostly worked with Jonathan (tutor) he's great and always tries to push me to learn other things. CareerÂ support is also helpful they organized many career sessions where you can meet with potential employers.Â I strongly recommend to take this course at UCLA extension to theÂ people who wants to change their field to ITÂ or who wants to improve on their programming skills. I engouraged many of my friends to take coding bootcamps instead of studying a course in the college because bootcamp gives you practical knowledge while college course gives you theoratical knowledge.Â ,238,1
UCLA,TRILOGY,6/23/17,,    Los Angeles , GitHub,5,5,5,5,TL;DRIgnore bootcamp stereotypes focus on yourself and what you want. Â The harder the struggle the better the payoff if its too easy step it up! This bootcamp will definitely challenge you but reward you by introducing you to new things people and ideas.Â Â If you're here it means that you're searching around for some way to better yourself and either improve on skills or learn new skills for a possible career. I was in the same boat about 9-10 months ago searching for a place where I could learn something entirely new to help change my life around. Â Fresh out of highschool I was accepted into Cal Poly San Luis Obispo'sÂ computer engineering program I thought I would be able to keep up but I soon had to drop out due to my grades and other difficulties. Â Shortly after IÂ spent 4 years getting a bachelors degree in IT and working customer service/help desk jobs not being able to break into the industry doing what I wanted to do for the next few years. After changing direction and doing web design for 6 months I appreciated the work I did with that and wanted to pursue that but only found out (at the time) in order to get into web design and development you needed a Computer Science/Engineering degree. Â I kept hearing this everywhere I went so I did research and wanted to go back to school but since I already had a bachelors degree alot of places were limited and would not let me apply. Â Schools not for everybody I guess right?It was then I heard about coding bootcamps but of course there was a trail of negativity and stereotypes behind them. Â I looked into SO many but none of them really fit what I was trying to accomplish or I couldn't afford them or I couldn't attend full time due to other obligations. Â But there comes a time in your life when you need to drop all your excuses forget everyone elses opinions and just go for it.Â I spoke with Alex to address all of my concerns about bootcamps what I will be learning possible career options and much more. Â Alex was very helpful and answered all of my questions patiently (IÂ think we spoke for over an hour). Â After talking with Alex I was a little more at ease about the program but still somewhat skeptical. I needed to just jump in and do it.What was great about this program was that it wasn'tÂ a WYSIWYG: it was a dynamic challenging frustrating tiring fun and emotional experience (for me at least). Â I didn't just learn \'Full Stack Flex Development\' or just strictly Javascript I was taught In conclusion you're going to find a lot of places and hear a lot of things. Â The decision is yours but I am highly recommendingÂ The Coding Bootcamp at UCLA Extension because of my experience and outcome.Â ,480,0
UCLA,TRILOGY,6/17/17,    Full Stack Flex - Part Time ,    Los Angeles , GitHub,5,4,5,5,Omar Patel is a great professor. He's very hands on and engaging. He's very open to new ideas of teaching to better engage students and get them excited about learning the subject. He makes himself available outside of class puts in the extra effort to get you the help you need and wants you to succeed. With every problem he challenges you to figure it out on your own but gives you the tools you need to get to the end result.The course is challenging and requires a lot of studying outside the class. You will succeed with the help provided the TA's and Omar are great but if you aren't willing to put in the work or seek out assistance when behind it will be extremely difficult to catch back up.When taking this course expect to be challenged and expect to put in the work every week and be ready to take advantage of all the assistance provided outside of class time.On top of teaching the material Omar provides a lot of assistance in finding jobs more than would be expected of him.,184,0
UCLA,TRILOGY,6/11/17,,    Los Angeles , GitHub,5,5,5,4,Ever wanted to learn how to code? Interested in joining a supportive community? If so then the Coding Boot Camp with UCLA is right for you! I know it was right for me in my personal experience. I had limited coding knowledge prior to joining but after 6 months I became confident in my ability as a junior web developer.Overall Experience:Â Curriculum:Instructors:Job Assistance:Basically the Coding Boot Camp with UCLA has been worth every dime and penny.

UCLA,TRILOGY,1/25/17,    Full Stack Flex - Part Time ,    Los Angeles , LinkedIn,5,5,5,5,This program is great for all levels of students from first time coders to students with CS degrees. The program is really well designed and structured to build upon theÂ previous weeks lesson and assignments.Even though this is \'part time\' it is very much a full time commitment. While I have a CS degree and have been coding for some time full stack was still new and at times it was a challenge to keep pace with the homework assignments AND work a full time job. Working fulltime and enrolling in this program isÂ possible but I would highly recommend discussing with team at UCLA Extension if you have the technical foundation to work full time and complete the homework and projects. Classes are essentially total approximately 12 hrs per weekÂ then you will be working on your homework and projects between 10-30hrs per week. Even if the homework is easy the more you put into this program the more you will get out of this program. That goes for both the technical AND the career building aspects of this program.I was already employed as a backend developer and took this program to learn the overall \'stack\' and the tools and technology involved. While the specific technology taught is not part of my day job (I code in python) learning Javascript and NodeJS along with the essential base engineering for web appliations has greatly improved my abilities at my current position. The career building information was also fantastic and has given me a great foundation how to present my skills and apply for a new job when I'm ready.ThisÂ program was worth every penny spent and very happy to have enrolled and recommend it highly!Â ,281,0
UCLA,TRILOGY,1/18/17,    Full Stack Flex - Part Time ,    Los Angeles , LinkedIn,5,5,5,5,This course is extremely helpful in starting a career in software development byÂ learning new material at a great pace and providing you with as many resources.The class curriculum is flexible and can change dependent on student learning flow andÂ the industry's evolving job requirements. The initial class schedule is based off the needed logic/material to learn basic web programming. As the course moves forward the teachers and career advisors becomeÂ open to any suggestions or changes that will help you to better understand material at your pace and/or increase your likelihood of finding a job. I really liked how students were able to vote on learning certain topics in the class and were given many opportunities for reviewing the material.The teachers were also always readily available to help. In class they are open ears majority of the time. They have a professional graps on the material and are very open-minded to the all levels of student experience. Â Although they have their own jobs outside of class they do try their best to respond to their student's messages/inquiries.The homeworks and projects were engaging and range in difficulty. Students are typically given two different levels of homework beginner or advanced. You have the freedom to choose one or both which helped many students choose their own pace. As someone who has learnedÂ a different programming language before the advanced homework was definitely doable for even the beginner programmer. It all depends on your learning pace and work ethic.The best thing about the course was being able to balance it with a full-time job. There were times when my time was very limited but the pace of the course really helped meÂ keep up with the material. The course requires you to keep an open mind and to constantly keep working hard for what you want.I highly recommend this course over many other bootcamps as they have shown sincere caring for their students. Whether you never studied programming before or have been doing it your whole life there is definitely something you can learn from this course. As long as you work for it you are guaranteed to achieve your own success.,355,0
UCLA,TRILOGY,6/6/17,,    Los Angeles , LinkedIn,5,5,5,4,This course is not EASY!!! It requires time and dedication. But don'tÂ let this discourage you the faculty team is supportive and knowledgeable. The instructor Omar Patel is amazing at presenting coding concepts and teacher's assistance makes themselves readily available for office hours. Â This course is part-time but you'll have to study and work outside of class to grasp the concepts. It is recommended that you put in 20 hours/week at times you'll be frustrated and doubting your intelligence. But happens to most students I had felt this way once or twice during this course but I survive and you too can do same.Â To do well in this course you'll need the following:1: Time Management: Allocate time to study the material do not rely on being spoon fed for material.2: Resilience: This is going to be difficult with a lot of material being thrown at you. Just remember your ultimate goal and how this course is going to help achieve this goal.Â 3. Open-mind: LearningÂ to develop is completely different and new and requires a different mindset. Â  When learningÂ these skills step in with an open mind and explore aÂ new perspective of thinking.Â ,190,0
UCLA,TRILOGY,8/29/17,    Full Stack Flex - Part Time ,    Los Angeles ,,5,5,5,5,In the beginning I personally didn't know what I was going to get from the course. I saw all of the reviews and promotion that were promising job placements and things of that nature. The class moves at a fast pace but if you put the time in and passionate about the subject this class is perfect for you! I love to code and this class gave me a great footing now I freelance and about to start applying for jobs with a lot more confidence that I had going in! I know I have the skills to compete in the job market I was taught all of the fundamentals and given resources to continue to grow on my own whether that is with or without a company. I am very grateful for this beautiful opportunity and if you are also looking to become a coder this is a great place to start!,153,0

UCLA,TRILOGY,6/26/17,,,,5,5,5,5,The Coding Bootcamp at the UCLA Extension was challenging but absolutely doable with the resources provided by faculty and one's ownÂ personal commitment. At first the material can be intimidating especially for people who do not have any prior experience programming but there was pre-work given before the first day of class in order to give every student exposure and to motivate and bring awareness to the difficulty of the course. The pace of the class is quick and it is very easy to fall behind if that happens you will be doomed to play catch up while the pace of the class gets quicker and quicker. I found that all of the assignments and in-class activities were dependent on your knowledge of the previous lessons in order to fully grasp the new material.Â It is very important to be able to teach yourself and know when to ask for help. The staff does a great job being supportive of every student's learning and providing help outside of class.Â Omar is an excellent professor he obviously a master of the craft and teaches it in the easiest way for everyone to be able to understand and will go the extra mile to help his students. He firmly believes in every student but will show tough love if a student does not make their own contribution.Â What you get out of the program is what you put into it.Â ,234,0
UCLA,TRILOGY,6/17/17,    Full Stack Flex - Part Time ,    Los Angeles ,,5,5,5,4,The course is very challenging for a student who has no background in the subject. Expect to put in tons of time outside of class if you want to succeed. At times the class can start to slow down but do not let these brief breaths of air fool you. It can be very easy to fall behind if you do not continue to pay attention and practice outside of class.Â The instructor Omar and all of the TAs and support staff are extremely helpful and available. Omar regularly hosted review sessions outside of class time and he really cares about the success of his students. He really pushes his students to succeed especially for the ones that really need the push.Â ,121,0
UCLA,TRILOGY,4/28/17,    Full Stack Flex - Part Time ,    Los Angeles ,,5,5,5,5,The reason I chose this bootcamp over all the othersÂ in LA was because it answered three questions I had about choosing a bootcamp. The first was could I keep my full-time job and take this bootcamp? The second was does this course teach the most relevant technologyÂ being used by hiring companies? And the third was are these teachers experts in their fields and are they good at teaching? I'll explain more below.This course is no joke even though it is part-time. In fact the process of going to work everyday and then shifting gears at the EOD to cram new conceptsÂ was one of the most difficult experiences I have ever been a part of. The payoff was immense and totally worth it though. The work ethic that was required to finish the homework and projects shines through when you begin your job interviews and solo projects. It was like working two jobs at once but your second job is a constant reminder as to how amazingly thought-provoking your new career can actually be. That and you can afford to eat and pay rent while you gain skills for a new career.The curriculum changed halfway through the course for our class. I only bring this up to emphasize the awareness the counselors and teachers had to re-evaluate the course to make sure the languages and frameworks being taught were the most relevant in the industry. The shift from PHP to Java showed that this bootcamp is not a mere money grab by UCLAÂ but a serious program that wants their students to find success in the real world. I was very happy about this and I saw it reflected in my job search as well.FinallyÂ the teaching staff. The two main instructors were current senior level software engineers that very clearly loveÂ what they do and wantedÂ to share their knowledgeÂ with the students. I really liked that the TA's were all basically former bootcamp grads that also have a love of learning programming and loved sharing thatÂ with others. The career counselors were all super supportive individuals that were always there if you needed them. No complaints here for any part of the teaching department.In conclusion I highly recommend this bootcamp for people that really want to get serious about jumping into a coding career. The amount of time and effort that it takes to do this and keep a full-time job is immense. You must make sacrifices if you want to seriously make it through. But that's going to happen regardless of the bootcamp you take. The reason you should take this one is because you can keep the lights on at your house while you do it the course is changing and stays up-to-date with industry standards and the teachers are top notch and very professional.Â ,462,0
UCLA,TRILOGY,1/17/17,,    Los Angeles ,,5,5,5,5,This program is a bootcamp so be prepared to invest some serious time and energy outside of class to really keep up. The program is perfect for those working full-time or who have other obligations. The staff are constantly checking in with you and are available for extra review of concepts. The career assistance has been on of my favorite aspects of the program which includes company tours guest speakers resume and LinkedIn profile help. This program is aÂ great introduction to programming concepts and provides a solid foundation for aspiring web developers. I would describe their approach as pragmatic rather than academic.Â ,102,0
UCLA,TRILOGY,1/10/17,    Full Stack Flex - Part Time ,    Los Angeles ,,5,5,5,5,Before going into detail it's important to explain the context around my particular objectives. Â I'm an experienced startup exec on the business side of thingsÂ who wanted to learn to code not to change careers but to become a better tech entrepreneur. Â So my experience is about learning more than the career-change aspect of the program. Before starting the program I'd only just started to try and learn to code. Â Having stumbled through some online courses I realized that being a classroom learner and people person it'd be a lot better to learn with others and to follow an integrated curriculum. Â I reviewed all of my options for bootcamps and since I needed to attend a part-time program The Coding Bootcamp at UCLA emerged as the best part-time option for me. Â It is a 6 month program and it is fairly intense especialy if you have a full-time job. Â Expect to put in about 10 hours in the classroom plus 15-20 on homework and projects.Â  You will definitely learn a lot perhaps too much! Â The curriculum is very up to date with the latest frameworks libraries and technologies. Â To be clear learning to code like an expert will take you several years and will be a lifelong activity since there is just so much material to cover. Â You will not be an expert after 6 months but will learn a lot and become very confident about how to find the answers. Â You will also have a roadmap for further learning.Â  By the end of the program you will have coded dozens of applications (at least one per week for the homeworks) and 3 group projects (two of them fullstack). Â The teachers are great and very commited. Â Shout out to Michael who is a coding/debugging machine and might even have a superhuman brain...and to Omar who is also super smart funny engaging and goes above and beyond helping students.Â  Gabrielle the career counselor is incredibly good at her job and the classmates are amazingly supportive. Â The community definitely makes the learning more fun and effective.Â I miss it already and would definitely recommend the program to anyone who wants to learn to code. Â I would do it again in a heartbeat.,368,0
UCLA,TRILOGY,12/19/16,,    Los Angeles ,,5,4,5,5,My reason for taking this course was to get ahead of my Computer Science program at my university. I have a background in biology and chemistry but had a great interest in coding and programming and didn't know how to be up to par with everyone in my undergrad program. CBC not only give meÂ the skills and the tools to learn how to program but also gave meÂ the closest thing to experiencing real world situations or experiences in the computer science field. in the program Â you get to work on your own as well as in teams whereÂ you can learn more technologiesÂ and learn from other students that may be more experienced that you. TheÂ instructors and the TAs are the best resources you could ever ask for. They are highly experienced individuals that have and are working in theÂ field that we all are trying to get in. The career and student support team are amazing as well. They will make sure that you are getting all the help you need as well as support you need through your whole journey. Trust me you'll want the emotional support when you go through the course haha. I definitely got what I intended to get from this program plus so much more. Worth every penny and worth every moment ofÂ struggle through this program. This was not an easy course I'll tell you that.Â I know I'm ready to face the challenges I'll be facing when I go back to my university next semester!!Â ,248,0
UCLA,TRILOGY,12/19/16,    Full Stack Flex - Part Time ,    Los Angeles ,,5,4,5,5,This class was exactly what I needed! I am from a business background who currently runs an E-Commerce Magento Website. I wanted to be able to develop on my own website and be able to do basic/intermediate things. ThisÂ classÂ isÂ very fast paced... this class will giveÂ you 2 year headstart in developing within 6 months. If you want to truly jump careers this is a great place to start. Developing is such an individual sport in the sense that there is so much to learn and resources to read.Â It is more like aÂ lifestyleÂ because it is impossible to learn everything. It is also a team sport because you cannot build a truly meaningful app without a team. This class gives you both experiences with all the focused homework and 3 Group Projects. Every experience was integral in learning what developing is really like.Â I run a large company and have a family. I spent alot of sleepless nights trying to stay on top of things. If you take this class I recommend you are fully devoted as if it was a 40 hour a week job. That is how you will gain the most from this class. Just trying to master the concepts taught in class will be a full time job.Â I do not recommend this class if you are already a seasoned developer looking to master a more niche topic. This class is for those who are looking to change careers from a non developing background. They are very dedicated in landing you the \'job\'.Â Note developing is such a deep skill that involves alot of \'struggle\'. This class makes the struggle alot easier.Â ,270,0
UCLA,TRILOGY,9/1/17,    Full Stack Flex - Part Time ,    Los Angeles ,,5,4,4,1,I recently completed the boot camp.Â  This is a pass or fail class so the grades are just for you to know how you are doing. Â You will learn a little about a lot of different topics and will need to spend 30-40 hours every week working on the homework and learning on your own. Â The TA's are very helpful but find the one you like best and always go go them when you can. Â It helps to build a working relationship because they will know your code and be able to help you better. Â Plus when you are looking for workÂ you have a current referenceÂ who knows your work when an employer asks for it. Â The homework assignments will keep you on your toes and take more than the part time hours they claim. Â This needs to be a full time commitment and if you make it you will come out knowing a lot. Â It will seem overwhelming at first but remember writing code you are going to be breaking and fixing your apps over and over and over again. Â You will fail you will make mistakes but the most important thing is to learn from them.Â The only part I thinkÂ needs improvement is the Career help. Â It was partly due to the fact that our orignal Career Success Manager was promoted and we were left without anyone or any help for 2 weeks. Â Then our new manager was just tossed in becauseÂ they did not bother to hire a replacement. Â She is nice but months behind on helping us. Â There is career homework and despite turning it it in on time it took months to get feedback if we got any. Â We had to turn in the the social media linksÂ we were required to have accounts on linkedin stackoverflow github and our portfolioÂ andÂ resume. Â We did not get feedback on them until 3 weeks before class ended and we were suppose to be looking for work 2 months before it ended. Â She was also to give presentations to help us but never showed up prepared and just made it up as she went along. Â Then the demo day is a waste of time do not bother going. Â They waited until the last minute to schedule it and only 6 people showed up most of whom were not hiring. Â Then she stood there giving lame excuses as to why nobody showed up and how it was beneficial to have fewer people there. Â Then a month after finishing she is finally asking for a copy of my cover letter and still has not given me feedback on it 2 weeks later.Summary learned a lot about web dev but got very little very lateÂ career help. Â I am still looking for paying work.,457,0

UCLA,TRILOGY,3/6/17,    Full Stack Flex - Part Time ,    Los Angeles ,,3,2,3,1,I recently graduated from the Trilogy/UCLA program. UCLA and other schools are partnering with a company called Trilogy. The owner is a former educator now capitalizing on the boot camp hype. He knows nothing about programming himself.I was originally sold on the program because it was part time over 6 months rather than full time over 3 months. This seemed to me a better way to really absorb the material because it's not realistic to code 12+ hours a day for 3 months and retain much like many of the other boot camps try to do. The brain just doens't work that way. I was also sold on the UCLA nameÂ thinking it would hold more weight than many of these code schools which are all incredibly new and don't have much of a reputation in the real world.Ultimately I made a poor decision. While the program started off reasonably well towards the end the last third of the program (2 out of 6 months) it pretty much fell apart for the following reasons:1) The curriculum kept changing. Originally we were to learn Angular PhP/Laravel. But sometime through this was changed to React React Native and Java. Ok no problem you might say. Except that each of those complicated topics got no more than 3 days of attention. So the time used to cover these topics at a very introductory level was pretty much wasted.2) Overall the curriculum tries to cover too many topics. You cover a lot of topics but at a very introductory level. And the time weighting for topics is distorted. For example you spend the first couple of months doing basic HTML/CSS/jQuery/JavaScript but then breeze through topics like Node Express databases React etc. Sure you have to set the foundation in the beginning but you can't breeze through complex topics and claim they've been taught.3) There is a big gap between teaching and learning meaning that the typical process for any given topic goes something like this...Â \'Here are steps 1-3...now go do the homework/projects incorporating steps 8-10. Figure out steps 4-7 on your own.\'4)Â Instructors are hit and miss. Some instructors are incredibly involved both in class and outside of class other instructors show up for class and that's the only time you hear from them. So outside of class it's up to you and the other students to figure everything out. There are \'office hours\' before and after most classes but when there are 30 or so students in each class there is only so much attention you're going to get.5) Project work can be hit and miss and it completely depends on which people you are teamed up with. I ultimately had a very poor project experience because on two of three projects half of my teams decided they just had no interest in making an effort. There are no negative ramifications for students not participating other than they don't learn.Â So of three projects I was supposed to haveÂ I ended up with a single project to present. That's not very impressive to employers when over a 6 month period you were able to pull together one project a project that was done over a single two week period.6) Project work is very very rushed. You typically get no more than 2 weeks to develop a full project and while you are working on your project you are bombarded with new material that you are expected to fully digest and in some cases were expected to incorporate into your in-process project. This was just ridiculous. As such most of the material taught during project weeks was competely ignored by most students.7) Demo day which is the day you get in front of \'partner\' companies was less than impressive. Less than half of the students (out of 60 or so total)Â participated and of those only a couple got offers from those partners. Other than that I don't know of anyone that has even had an interview with those companies.8) Career services consist of the boot camp making sure you're sending out a bunch of resumes and some guy in another state sending you daily emails of job links even though he knows nothing about your market what you're looking for etc. Some people have gotten jobs but many others have sent out well over 100 resumes and gotten little to no response. Some people already had jobs and aren't looking. You have a mix of experiences. But overall the program even the UCLA nameÂ appears to carry no weight in the market. This could vary by market and school.Overall what the program provides is some structure around learning. But just keep in mind that you're only getting a very high level introduction to a bunch of topics and will not come out of the program being well-versed in any one topic unless you can become so on your own time. The students that did well are those that had some experience coming into the program. Most of those with no experience struggled a great deal or rode on the coattails of the more experienced folks. Even the experienced folks sometimes had problems.I'm sure the program continues to improve because my cohort complained quite a bit in the weekly surveys and during class. And hopefully Trilogy is listening. But personally based on my experience I can't recommend the program.PS: You'll notice all of the glowing reviews of the program (I know all of these people)Â and you'll notice the wonderful response from the program. Remember they are trying to sell you to enroll. And honestly the program doesn't do well with negative feedback. Much of the response during the program was to push the blame back onto the students. I don't know any other business that works this way.,958,0
UCLA,TRILOGY,1/26/17,    Full Stack Flex - Part Time ,    Los Angeles ,,5,5,5,5,This class was excellent! Definitely helped me in both my skillset and my career. One great thing about this program is that it cultivates a support system within the cohorts. We were encouraged to seek help not only from our teachers but from other students as well. Another good thing about this bootcamp is that teachers and career advisors were amazing at hearing our concerns. Help is certainly there when a student would need it. All in all I would definitely recommend this bootcamp and is a great way to enter the technical field!Â ,94,0
UCLA,TRILOGY,12/19/16,    Full Stack Flex - Part Time ,    Los Angeles ,,5,5,5,5,Definitely loved everything about this bootcamp. It was a great experience for someone who had no idea how to code in any sort of language. They taught the fundamental and developed a base of strong foundation to the \'newbies\' and the patience that the TA's and instructorÂ had with all the students was quite commendable. The staff were always encouraging and pushing all the students to higher heights while also creating great relationships that helped with \'awkwardÂ imposter syndrome\' that normally occurs in the beginning of a program. I was hired to my engineering department near the end of the program and I/m applying a lot of foundational knowledge I learned from this bootcamp at my current job. They work with those who are workign full-time as well so if you're dedicated then you'll definitely be able to change careers!Â ,138,0
UNC CHAPEL HILL,TRILOGY,2/7/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Chapel Hill , LinkedIn,5,5,5,0,Boot camp was a great learning experience and lot of fun.Â The classroom material andÂ homework exercises areÂ excellent.I am pretty sure they will serve as handy references for years to come. I love the fact that everythign will be accessible after completing the class.I learned lot of new concepts and refreshed some of my older concepts about web development.I have already started using node in developing microservice architecture for my devops activities.The classes are rightly paced. Nick is an excellent teacher very knowledgeable and approachable always ready to help.Ilyssa is a great help. Because of her help and encouragementÂ I was able to get more than 100% from this courseÂ ,107,0
UNC CHARLOTTE,TRILOGY,8/23/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Charlotte , LinkedIn,5,5,5,5,This bootcamp has been one of the best educational experiences IÂ have ever had. It isÂ fast-paced and challenging but in the end you'll have all the necessary skills required for theÂ Charlotte job market. The amount of resources and support from the entire team is unrivaled.Â I'm amazed at all the skills I gained in this course and evenÂ convinced a buddy of mine to take the bootcamp.Â I highly recommend this bootcamp to anyone pursuing a career as a developer.,76,0
UNC CHARLOTTE,TRILOGY,8/2/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Charlotte , LinkedIn,5,5,5,5,I went to the UNCC CodingÂ Bootcamp without any knowledge about code or programming. It was the best experience I ever had the teaching and student support staff is amazing the program is unique and constantly getting updated to fit the current market need in Charlotte area. The Bootcamp gives you tools and skillset to become a great Full Stack Web Developer. However it is not easy you have to put in a lot of time to reach yourÂ goal.You have to be preparedÂ to work in the team learning Google-ing and have fun!,91,0
UNC CHARLOTTE,TRILOGY,7/26/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Charlotte , LinkedIn,5,4,5,5,Like other reviewers have mentioned this is a legitimately hard course. Depending on your background this may be one of the harder educational ventures in your life. However in my opinion it is That being said you must approach this program with the proper attitude. If you do the bare minimum your chances of breaking into development post-graduation are slim. That may sound harsh but it's the reality of the situation and if you know this going in you are far more likely to succeed. The good news is you are So is this course right for you? If you thrive on a challenge and know coding is the career path for you then I would wholeheartedly recommend this program.Â ,120,0
UNC CHARLOTTE,TRILOGY,8/22/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Charlotte ,,5,5,5,5,I was interested in a change of direction for my career had some previous coding experience and knew that the internet is just a series of tubes. Before applying I considered online courses but was more interested in the advantages of being part of an in person group dedicated to the same goal -Â it was amazing the growth in skill and confidence of the entire cohort!Â The support was great from the TAs to Career Services and Student Success. The instructors clearly care about the students and have a passion for the craft. Guiding a group of 25-50 people of diverse backgrounds is not easy and a curriculum that listens to market trends may have to adjust on the fly. Sometimes the road is bumpy.Â The program is challenging and fast paced but rewarding if youâ€™re willing and able to commit the time and effort.,143,0
UNC CHARLOTTE,TRILOGY,6/28/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Charlotte ,,5,4,5,4,The Coding Boot Camp at UNCC taught me many of the fundamentals of Web Development in a short 6 months. The program was tough at times and easy at other times. Through the skills I learned during both the technical curriculum as well as the offerred career curriculum I was able to procure a position about a month after graduating the course with having absolutely no coding knowledge prior to signing up. The instructor was amazing and a greatÂ developer with a sense of humor and passion for teaching that really helped during the tougher sections of the class.,98,0
UNC CHARLOTTE,TRILOGY,7/26/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Charlotte ,,5,5,5,4,Your mileage may vary but here's my take:,8,0
UC SAN DIEGO,TRILOGY,8/8/17,    Web Development Methods ,    San Diego , LinkedIn,5,5,5,0,I got a ton out of this course I'll try to highlight some of the best and worst things.Â Pros:1. Top tier instructors. These guys know their stuff and are always extremely helpful. They even began to take pride in us and our coding towards the end lol.2. TA's have your back. I remember before the class started someone asked something like \'how patient are you guys if I can't learn fast enough?\' a TA replied \'I can stare at a wall for 12 hours and not get bored\'. This is true.3. The career support throughout the class is optional but you'd have to be insane not to opt in. They will teach you skills that will help your career. Even if you aren't looking for a job you need to take advantage of this knowledge and support. You don't need to wait until the end of the course to start testing your career skills.Â I was receiving job offers before the class was even over. If you feel ready tell your career instructor and they will happily point you in the right direction.4. The class content was amazing. They don't just teach you content they train you to use your resources to be able to teach yourself. In my opionion this is what being a developer is all about.5. Academic support. There is an entire group of people dedicated to helping you if you ever start to feel behind all you have to do is ask. I never took advantage of this perk but I know a few people who got private tutoring sessions.Cons:1. The cost. This isn't a cheap course. I was able to justify the cost by thinking of the salary potential. I got a promotion at my work as a result of this course. Because of this I didn't take advantage of the post-course job assistance.2. The time. You can't get the benefits without effort. You need to dedicate not only time but also a ton of frustrated learning hours. Hang in there.Â If you have the time money and dedication this course will teach you skills that you can use for the rest of your career. You get out what you put in so jump in with both feet and be ready to work hard.,377,0
UC SAN DIEGO,TRILOGY,8/4/17,    Web Development Methods ,    San Diego , LinkedIn,5,5,5,5,As a nerd I've always wanted to learn how to code seriously. There are many coding boot campsÂ in San Diego but I find this one to be the right price point and a bit cheaper than mostÂ (about 2k-3k). It's also part-time during the evening so it fits my busy schedule.I've already had a Bachelor's and Master's degree in education policy so I wanted coding to add to my skill set and not just a second Bachelor's in Computer Science.I was also able to find employment due to this program. I can do things like tinker with a githubÂ account and know what the heck folks are saying on StackOverflow and other codingÂ help forums.Â I also wrote more about my experience here:Â https://medium.com/@minhtuyen/ucsd-coding-boot-camp-projects-63e3127d4f88,119,0
UC SAN DIEGO,TRILOGY,8/1/17,    Web Development Methods ,    San Diego , GitHub,5,4,5,4,I thought the bootcamp was overall good. I feel that I learned a lot and in fact I am going to be TAing for the next session. My only piece of feedback and something I plan on bringing to my session is that there should be a little more stratified challenges. I get that it is difficult to cater to each individual student's skill set however I think it would be beneficial to the students on both ends of the spectrum to have a little bit of bonus material to challenge the students who are excelling and to reinforceÂ concepts for students who are struggling.Â ,104,0
UC SAN DIEGO,TRILOGY,8/9/17,    Web Development Methods ,    San Diego ,,5,5,5,5,Having recently graduated I can say that the bootcamp assisted and played a role in fully transforming my outside interest in tech and innovation into a full-on career in the field. I had aspirations for a long time before taking the course but it was ultimately the step that I NEEDED to take to advance myself.Â Â If you're worried that you don't have enough of a technical background to get started FEAR NOT. I started the course quite literally at a blank slate (barely knowing the difference between HTML CSS and JavaScript for reference) and within a few weeks of struggle and patience became \'comfortable with being uncomfortable\' which is something the instructors always preached. Ultimately you will gain a lot out of this program if you stick with it and think long-term.Â ,132,0
UC SAN DIEGO,TRILOGY,8/18/17,    Web Development Methods ,    San Diego ,,1,1,1,1,This Bootcamp is put on by a company called Trilogy and not UC San Diego. The trilogy team is very inexperienced - just go through the beginning enrollment process and it should be very clearÂ to you. Everyone involved is very careless and unhelpful.Much better options in San Diego you'll get a lot more out of another program.Â ,57,0
UCIRVINE,TRILOGY,8/2/17,,    Irvine ,,5,5,5,5,This program is very new and so I can see a few flaws but this is a really great fit for me. I was extremely nervous about dumping a lot of money in a coding bootcamp but if you want to get into tech this is definitely worth it. Let me start with my main that I had.This along with a lot of other coding bootcamps definitely seemed like a scam to me. For this program I really wish that they didn't make it feel like such a scam. The whole phone \'\'interview\'\' and \'You have been accepted!!\' is really bogus. If you want it you'll get accepted. Why lie about it? I believe this program would get so much better attention if they were just honest and straight up. Here's the cost here's what we expect from you and here's what we give you. That kind of honesty will bring more people than trying to make everyone feel like they're so lucky!!Â That being said this program is definitely worth it. Since it was only the second cohort ever I only had to pay 8500. I did A TON of research on coding bootcamps in general before making the decision to drop all this money. But I found that 8500 is relatively cheap. Anyone who goes through these coding bootcamps will get a job due to the high demand for programmers in the field. So it is a cheap price to pay for a 6 month path to a whole new career.Â It is now August and I have to say I am really impressed with the program. At the end of the day almost every coding bootcamp will find you a job if you really want it. I think that's important to note because you shouldn't be trying to pay 20k for a program just because you're concerned about not getting a job. If you want a job and you put in the work you will find one.As for this class curriculum it is very well rounded. They are definitely full stack and the career help start right away! They have counselors always there ready to listen to any of your concerns. They also host awesome events like tech panels where employers come and talk! It's a lot of fun and we are currently just starting the group projects. The teachers for each class both have a lot of experience and are very nice and helpful! There are two classes (forrest and Caeser). I feel like they could train the TA a little better and have more organization but I certainly don't blame them since the program is so new. At the end of the day I am learning A LOT and i'm already feeling very comfortable coding.Â Â 5/5 would recommend to anyone! I'm just trying to give an honest review to anyone out there. If you're worried about the career change scared of dumping the money and fear that everything is fake out there. Don't worry I was in your shoes. I can tell you though the job marketing is extremely well. And this course will definitely give you the guidance if you're like me and scared to learn on my own. If you take this program you will find a job! The career service team will even help you find a job in another state if you request they are very accomodating.Â Â I hope this helped anyone who is curious! I apologize if my writing is all over the place i'm going off the top of my head right now.Â ,590,0
UCIRVINE,TRILOGY,5/28/17,    Full Stack Web Development ,    Irvine ,,1,2,1,0,I would caution against even filling out an application. Like others I did the easy little tests and phone interviews. I was \'recomended for enrollement\' and then they emailed a poorly worded hokey credit card form asking for my $2500 hold money. They worded the email in a way that made you think you owed them money so pay the invoice and hold your seat in the class! In a separate email they sent a auto-fill form -- with just a couple clicks you accepted all the terms of enrollment and were bound to the company.Â I never filled these forms out and never accepted or signed a thing. I even spoke to the rep confirming that I did not actually owe anything and that until I actually enrolled I was still in decision-making mode.So after reading enough about the company and weighing my options I simply emailed the rep a \'Thanks but no thanks\' letter explaining that I declined to enroll and would pursue my coursework online via Udemy and Udacity and that I appreciated their time.She called me a day later and \'Congratulated me on pursuing my education in code.\'Â I was a little confused becuase she made it sound like I enrolled in the school. I told her thanks and sorry I couldn't go forward with UCI extension. I told her if things ever changed I would let her know. She acknowledged this and said it was ok and she understood.A week later onÂ theyÂ send an email (probably automated) as follows:\'Dear NatalieThis is a notification that your card will be charged in 2 days.Thank You\'I don't know if this was an atuo email but it seemed pretty shady. From the enrollement email to the weird \'Congratualtions\' phone call to this... it'sÂ like they were trying to play dumb and act like I was enrolled.Just avoid this type of annoyance and find some other bootcamp. Learning Fuze in Orange County has a pretty good reputation. Go there. Stay away from these shady sketchy people.,332,0
UCIRVINE,TRILOGY,7/24/17,    Full Stack Web Development ,    Irvine ,,4,5,4,0,I recently enrolled for the Coding Boot Camp at UC Irvine Continuing Ed in partnership with Trilogy Education Services. The enrollment process has been smooth so far and everyone has answered all the questions I have asked at both UCI-CE and Trilogy. I was at first skeptical about it since technically this is a Trilogy Education Service program that is run at UC Irvine along with many other Extension and Continuing Ed programs across the country. I did a lot of research and looked up reviews at all the other schools to see what the feedback was and almost all of it is good. The UCI program only started this year so there hasn't been a cohort to finish yet but UCLA has had good sucess so I would look at that program as I imagine it will be very similar to UCI's. There are also some good reviews and feedback on Reddit too if you want to look them up. The current instructors they have are getting great feedback from the current students from what I have heard.Like everything in life you get what you put into it so if you aren't willing to do the work outside of the classroom I would look elsewhere. What really sold me on the program was the part-time 24 week program. I work full-time and the class schedule will work well with my schedule and family. There isn't any other part-time programs in the area that cover the Full-Stack I only saw one other one that was a 10-week course and only covered the Front-End. I also like that spread out over 6 months instead of cramming it all in 12 weeks which is much better suited to my learning style.I'm looking forward to getting started on the pre-course work and diving in head first come September. I'll update my review a few weeks into the course.,315,0
UC BERKELEY,TRILOGY,8/29/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    San Francisco ,,1,2,1,0,Be aware of this Berkeley coding boot camp. When you interested in the course and contact them they will call you many thousand times. After you pay the deposit $2500 upfront be aware that $1000 is no refundable even you did not go your first day of the class. Also If you have any questions they don't want to answer you on the phone. They will block your phone number and you will directly into voicemail and never call into their admission main line. They reply email also very slowly like around 2 or 3 days later. They just want your money. After you pay your deposit they don't care about anything.,112,0
UT AUSTIN,TRILOGY,8/28/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Austin , GitHub,4,4,5,4,If you have no idea where to start in the world of web development this program is great for teaching you the basics and learning some industry-used technology. The main takeaway is that you get out what you put it. Even if the assignment seems super easy the amount of effort you put in it will still impact you later in the program. In projects especially challenge yourself because these will be seen by potential employers.Don't hesitate to talk to TAs and your instructor. They will help you if you are willing to put in the effort.If you already know a good deal about web development and the technologies industry uses/may use in the future this probably isn't for you and may do better with personal research instead.,128,0
UT AUSTIN,TRILOGY,7/12/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Austin , GitHub,5,5,5,5,I am so glad I chose the UT Coding Bootcamp. I was able to continue working full time with attending class during the week and on the weekends. It was not easy but very much worth it.Having a passion for coding this camp was perfect for me to round out my skills learn new libraries and make me more marketable to my employer. We learned the in and outs of the MERN stack and high level back-end and front-end web developement. I really appreciated finding out the camp changed the course because of local market demands.At times I felt like the course didn't dive into the material deep enough. However that is sort of the point to the Bootcamps it gives you a solid jumpping off point to do more in less time than you could on your own.The passion from the teachers and TAs was very encouraging and got me excited to be in class every day. The staff has also been very active at keeping us in the loop and getting us ready for Demo day. I've never felt like there wasn't support available. Everyone is avalible within hours and very responsive on Slack. Tutors were also availabe for even more help.I met a lot of people made a new friendsÂ and have grown my network exponentially! The other cohorts are working on meetups and networking events to meet prior graduates and future students. There is a big sense of community.Ultimately I got way more out of the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp than I everÂ thought.Â I looked at other camps but the biggest deciding factor for me was being part of the University of Texas system. Attending class on campus made me feel even more invested in the class and havingÂ UT put their name on the class gave the bootcamp the validity that other bootcamps do not have.Â ,308,0
UT AUSTIN,TRILOGY,8/29/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Austin ,,5,4,5,5,The UT Coding Bootcamp was one of my favorite experiences! I had always been interested in the world of computer programming but had no idea where to start until a friend showed me the bootcamp and I am so glad that they did.Â Through out the program I not only learned how to read and write in mulitple programming languages but I also learned how to explain my code to both industry professionals and those who have no coding experience. We also covered computer science basics to where we could seamlessly transfer our coding knowledge into multiple areas through out the technological landscape.Â Also my instructor Eric was the best! He made class fun and engaging. The enitre class got pretty close with group hangouts and multiple inside jokes!Seriously if you are looking for a great bootcamp you need not look any further!,141,0
UT AUSTIN,TRILOGY,8/28/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Austin ,,5,5,5,5,this course had a great curriculum that could benefit new coders but also experienced ones.

UT AUSTIN,TRILOGY,2/22/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Austin ,,5,4,5,5,I chose the UT Austin Full Stack CodingÂ Boot Camp because it allowed me to still work full time while learning at night and on the weekends. It was tough. And it was so worth it.I was so pleased with the quality and passion of the UT staff to help place graduates it was good to know that there was a team of people pushing for you. Their help and support was just a phone call away.I wouldn't call myself a talented writer but the two pieces of advice that I can give are:The experiences and friendships that I have gained during the 24 week long program are why I was able to make a complete career change to something I really enjoy doing.,123,0
UT AUSTIN,TRILOGY,1/15/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Austin ,,5,5,5,5,With previous experience in only sales/corporate roles I was astounded to step into the world of web development and be both welcomed and challenged to grow more than I ever haveÂ by means of The Coding Bootcamp at UT. The standards and quality of curriculum are high and consequently open the door of opportunity for students of varying previousÂ backgrounds to shift into web development and engineering positions with easiblity.I am a strong advocate for education innovation and it makes me proud to be a graduate of this bootcamp. Furthermore the contacts you make through the many outlets of instructional staff student success managers career services guest speakers and your own tech-driven classmates are limitless. I am happy to have built relationships with so many people I respect and that have a genuine interest in my success - several of which I now have the privilege of calling close friends.Thank you UTCB team andÂ a few special shoutoutsÂ to Jeremy Bergeron Roger Le and Lisa BattleÂ for showing tremendous faith in me and helping support my new career in tech!,175,0
UT AUSTIN,TRILOGY,12/5/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    Austin ,,5,5,5,5,I went into the UT coding bootcamp with very little coding experience. I was previously a construction superintendant and the only coding experience I had was the intro to html css and javascript courses offered by codecademy. Fast forward 6 months and my dreams have come true. I'm now a full time JavaScript developer. It wouldn't have been possible without the great people and curriculum from the UT coding bootcamp. In 6 months they took me from a total beginner to feeling confident to apply for jobs that had a salary most people dream of. Whether you want to specialize in design or dive deep into the backend then the UT coding bootcamp will equip you with the skills to do.Â Â Also aÂ special shoutout to my instructor Roger Le TAs JeddÂ Allen and Josh and career coach Jeremy Bergeron for all the effort you put into the students. You beyond showed that you really cared.,153,0
UT AUSTIN,TRILOGY,10/26/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    Austin ,,5,4,5,5,TL;DR: Yes do it.Bootcamps will never be a cure-all so if youâ€™re looking for that stop reading and step off this metaphorical locomotive. If youâ€™re looking for an invitation to join the world of programming and reignite your own curiosity jump aboard.My previous career was as a classical musicianâ€”opera singer in particularâ€”so you could say that I came to software development/programming from about as far away as possible. If I can do it so can you and The Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin will give you the tools you need.If youâ€™re reading this youâ€™ve probably already blown through some online resources and thatâ€™s where I was. My largest problem with learning how to code was figuring out the large concepts. I wanted to learn but I didnâ€™t know where or HOW to look for the next step. The Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin provided that essential step.Â Â We covered Javascript from client side to backend and hit most technology thatâ€™s used in shops all around Austin (Mongo Express React Node.js). Pounding one language gave me the skill to look at other languages and not tremble with fear and anxiety. Likewise everything we learned is something I use on a daily basis.Â Moreover Jim McCoy and Roger Leâ€”our instructorsâ€”gave me enough information to take off and explore on my own. They are awesome teachers in their own right and theyâ€™re interested in our continued success. Holly Rob Allen and Jedd (our TAâ€™s) did a stellar job of supporting us throughout the learning process. Help was never too far away but thankfully it wasnâ€™t too close either. A huge part of learning how to code is learning how to solve problems on your own and the academic team made sure our class had ample time to flex our problem solving muscles.Another important element that differentiates the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin from others in the area is its strong Career Services support. Jeremy Bergeron and Candace Salim helped me build my brand hone my message and clean up my materials to present the best version of myself. Then they introduced me to awesome companies.Â Â To sum up what my experience with the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin hereâ€™s a quote that I love (yes it's cheesy but it's honest): \'Everybody says they're trying to get their piece of the pie. They don't realize that the world is a kitchen. You can make your own pie.\' - Terry Crews. They didnâ€™t make the pie for me but they sure gave me a good recipe.Â If youâ€™re interested in taking the next step this is the place for you.,431,0
UT AUSTIN,TRILOGY,10/22/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    Austin ,,5,4,4,5,Highly recommend this boot camp if you're looking to get started with aÂ developer career. Never did I feel like I was asking a stupid question and the staff was always willing to help! Overall I felt it was an awesome learning environment. However be aware that in order to be successful you need a lot of time outside of class to fully immerse yourself in the material.Â ,67,0
UT AUSTIN,TRILOGY,10/18/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    Austin ,,5,4,5,5,ABOUT ME: Just to put my experience into perspective I came from a varied background in sales freelance photography and videography. I loathed going into my sales job every day and wanted a career change but wasn't exactly sure how to go about it or what direction to head. I randomly came across a bootcamp and was intrigued at the idea. Become a web developer in 24 weeks? I had taken a basic HTML/CSS class in college several years ago and while I certainly enjoyed it that sounds a little too good to be true. My options were to either go back to school through UT or ACC or look more into a bootcamp weighing the pros and cons of each. Once I decided this was certainly the direction I wanted to headÂ I started researching local bootcamps more in-depth of which several exist. The Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin checked off every box I was looking for: part-time so that I could continue to work a full-time job career services a reasonable price and it was backed by the UT name.Â INTERVIEW: After applying I went through a couple of phone interviews. I was asked about my background why I want to get into coding and was asked to solve a couple of fairly difficult problem-solving questions.Â Honestly I feel like I barely made the cut. After two phone interviews though I was accepted!CURRICULUM: Starting out we learned the basics: HTML CSS and Javascript. The overall curriculum focused on the MERN stack (MongoDB Express React Node.js). Over the course of 6 months we learned all sorts of other frameworks libraries and languages too such as Bootstrap jQuery andÂ MySQL. We briefly touched on a few languages such as PHP Ruby and Python. The only reason I gave the curriculum a 4 star rating is because I thought we should have focused more on React and PHP and become more \'specialized\' in a few areas as opposed to knowing a little about a lot. We were the very first cohort however and their material will become even more focused and streamlined I feel as more people go through the course. I am extremely impressed at how flexible the curriculum is. It's all based on what the local companies are hiring for and the whole team has a fantastic sense of what those are.Â CLASS: One of the things I liked most about participating in a bootcamp was just how diverse the other students are. Almost everybody is there for the same reason: a career change. I believe that because of our varied backgrounds bootcamp grads have a more well-rounded approach to development and can draw from past experiences in other fields to help achieve goals and work on teams with other developers. My background in sales has certainly helped me whether I like to admit it or not. Just to give you an idea of how diverse my cohort was... we had a former opera singer a Spanish teacher a skee ball champion an American Sign Language interpretor a warehouse salesman... the list goes on.Â INSTRUCTORS/TA's: I was in the Monday/Wednesday class taught by Jim McCoy with Holly Springsteen and Rob Daly. Jim really made the course for me. He is hilarious in a no-filter kind of way extremely intelligent and definitely cares about seeing us succeed. Holly and Rob gave up a lot of their evenings and weekends for 6 months to see us succeed and they are equally as intelligent and helpful. I firmly believe that all of their effort was crucial to our success as a class.CAREER SERVICES: Jeremy Bergeron and Candace Salim are the two I'm most familiar with behind Career Services but I'm sure there were several other people behind-the-scenes that did a ton of work for us as well. Jeremy is a great guy and his passion for landing us jobs is obvious. They helped us in optimizing resumes LinkedIn profiles and interview techniques and would usually bring in a speaker each Saturday to talk about various topics. One of the best things we did was mock interviews with employees from local well-known companies followed up by a panel discussion. I used a few of the interview techniques we talked about that day and I strongly believe that because of the things I learned then I was able to actually receive an offer and accept it - on my very first tech interview! The dev team I interviewed with was super impressed by the questions I asked and how well I handled the whiteboard interview and the entire team behind this bootcamp was essential to that experience.Â OTHER: The pace of the class was sometimes too fast but it's because there's SO much material that could be covered. They constantly asked for feedback from us and would often adjust the pace based on how we responded. Aside from the pace one important thing I discovered is that with a lot of companies there is a sort of stigma surrounding bootcamp graduates. What I mean by that is that a lot of people will enter a bootcamp just for the sake of making more money. While that part is great you have to be able to convey that you actually OVERALL EXPERIENCE: I was fortunate to be one of the students who got accepted into a full-time web developer role before graduation and I can't thank the people behind The Coding Bootcamp enough. I'm now not dreading going in to work I am doing work that I actually enjoy with awesome and intelligent coworkers and making more money than ever on top of that. As long as you go in with realistic expectations you understand your strengths and weaknesses as a student and have an actual passion for coding I believe that the curriculum and staff behind The Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin will almost certainly land you a new job.Â ,979,0
UT AUSTIN,TRILOGY,10/12/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    Austin ,,5,5,5,5,Here's the TLDR I would absolutely recommend attending this boot camp with the caveat that you have to be realistic about time management. If you don't have to work while you attend or if you work but have minimal commitments to loved ones then you can get tremendous value from this boot camp more than many college degrees would yield. If on the other hand you have to work a full time job and have kids or a significant other competing for your attention then you may not get as much value out of the course. Just be honest with yourself but if you have the time this course is a phenomenal investment.Here's the full review.About Me: I had been teaching myself to code on and off for almost two years before starting the boot camp and as soon as I heard of it which was a day or two after it was launched I applied and was accepted. The prior coding experience I had due to my self-study was tremendously helpful so I would advise you to have as much self-study as possible before applying but it is definitely notÂ necessary to succeed asÂ several of the students that have already landed jobs did not have prior self study. Today was the last day of class and I'm glad to say that the future looks very bright.Overall Experience: I felt privileged to attend the boot camp with the folks that I was lucky enough to have as my classmates. It seemed like everyone in the class including the TA's and the instructor had an interesting story and was an overachiever in one way or another. We had a Fulbright Scholar a CPA and a national skee ball champ just for starters. It was an eclectic bunch and I'm really thankful to have met these folks and gotten to work with them. I'm actually quite curious as to what they'll be investing their energies into in 5 or 10 years.Instructors: The instructor and the TA's for the course were great they all really knew their stuff. Also they always arrived early to class and left late so we had a ton of time to pick their brains on anything. They were always available for me to reach out to not only on class content but also on bigger-picture topics like career advice and I really appreciated that. All my instructors actually worked full time jobs as web developers in addition to their roles in the boot camp so they had their fingers on the pulse of the web development scene in Austin. They're really good people...it's hard to convey this but it's more than a job to them. For reference I was in the Tuesday/Thursday class with Roger Le as the instructor and Jedd Fenner Josh Madewell and Allen Wes as the TA's but on Saturdays the classes joined together into one large class and I was lucky to have Holly Springsteen and Rob Daly as TA's then as well. For brevity's sake I'll just say that if you get the chance to learn under any of these folks rest assured that you're in good hands.Curriculum: The curriculum is focused on the MERN stack for which there's a strong market in Austin right now but it's very flexible to the market's needs and changes were made to the course's curriculum as we were going through it. When you think about that it's really amazing no college course I've ever been to has been responsive in real-time to the needs of the market and that's one of the things that sets this course apart from a college course.Â Through this course in addition to learning web developmentÂ you'll also become extremely confident in your ability to learn anything which is an invaluable skill in today's economy as it allows you to chart your own path.Job Assistance: This boot camp does not come with a job guarantee. That said several students landed well-paying jobs before we even graduated. TwoÂ girls landed what could be described as their respectiveÂ dream jobs.Â For the most part career services consists of help with polishing up your resume and cover letter introductions here and there based on your interests and background and requiring you to apply to a certain amount of jobs per week once the course finishes. We also have industry speakers come to class on Saturday mornings and share what it's like to work at their companies.Â I started the application process about a week ago and I already had an interview which I can directly attribute to my cover letter resume and my portfolio and the contents thereof all of which have been substantially improved due to my having attended the boot camp and my having taken advantage of career services.Â I'll say this having completed the boot campÂ as I readÂ job descriptionsÂ I find myself readingÂ requirements and thinking \'Hey I can do that!\' And if I can't do that I think \'Hey I can learn that!\' It's pretty swell.I hope this helped you make a more informed decision and if you have the time to invest into yourself don't hesitate enroll in the course!,851,0
UT AUSTIN,TRILOGY,10/4/16,,    Austin ,,1,3,3,0,I got called by aÂ very long-windedÂ 'Admissions Advisor' for this program 1st time during work hours at my job soÂ I asked him to call me back the next day. The time we had agreed upon came and went so I started playing a chess game online thinking he was not going to call. He ended up calling and asking me if I had time to chat (no indication this was any kind of formal interview) so I told him I did although I was a bit distracted due to my game. He asked if I had any questions so I asked a series of questions over a 10-15Â minute period about the curriculum admissions requirements coding languages covered placement rates for graduates getting hired coursework program cost etc. For some reason about 15Â minutesÂ into theÂ conversationÂ he seemed to think that I was having 'doubts' about the program (I never expressed doubts). At this point I had asked all my immediate questions -- and also was a little thrown off by the fact that he kept raising 'doubts' -- so I asked him whether he could just please send me the application and allow me to send further questions via email. Then I asked if he had any questions for me.Up to now he had asked ZERO questions about my own background. He told me that based on our conversation which he referred to as a 'screening interview' despite no hint of this in his introduction and a total lack of him interviewing meÂ he thought that I \'did not have the temperament personality or background for the program\' (he still at this point knows nothing about me other than my name and that I am femaleÂ and based on the qualifications he listed I would think I'd be quite competitive; I have a masters from a top 20 university a strong background in analytical courses and enjoy what coding I've done) but basically seemed to be trying to shame me for being distracted at the start of the call HE was late for. On top of all this he had the mannerisms and ennunciations of an 80s car salesman throughout the call making me feel uncomfortably as though he was trying to sell me something and throwing into doubt the legitimacy of the program for me until I read the reviews online. And as the icing on the cake for all this I had to resign a rated chess game on my account. I can't speak to the quality of this course and I'm sure the actual classes areÂ great but this really threw a sour note on my perception of it.,435,0
UT AUSTIN,TRILOGY,8/19/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    Austin ,,5,4,5,5,As with many of these reviews I will certainly follow up once the course is over. We are currently in week 18.I can't speak for other students in the class but I can tell you my story. I started this course with no web development knowledge at all. I spent a couple ofÂ hours on freecodecamp before starting this course and I have watched online courses like Harvard'sÂ CS50 but I didn't know where to start when putting together even the most basic website.I found that this course has walked me through the most basic first baby steps of web development and then rapidly given me the tools and explained how to use some more advanced concepts to create real practical modern websites.Â The first month of the class was spent learning HTML CSS Bootstrap and the basics to create the front-end of a website. Towards the end of that month and into the next month we dived into Javascript jQuery API's and some lesser known database tools (Firebase). After learning how to buildÂ a responsive front-end we moved towards Nodejs MySQL and Express. We just started learning MongoDB this week.Â Instructors in the course have been excellent. We have had guest instructors occasionally and I have noticed they have been testing the waters with these guest instructors to see if they would be able to handle the job as instructors for their own cohorts. I have seen a few guest instructors end up as instructors of their own cohorts and one of our TA's was promoted to instructor for his own class as well (well deserved).Â I've seen other reviews on this website that question the effectiveness of certain instructors but as a student in the Tues/Thurs class I can say our instructor has been extremely effective and I've enjoyed every minute. The instructor from the Mon/Wed class seems to be skilled in teaching his class as well and when he has hosted the combined class on Saturday I've found his sense of humor to be top-notch.Regarding other expressed concerns on this site about the availability of instructors I feel like their availability is on par with my expectations. From applying to this course to going through the interview to the first day in class the expectation was set that this course relies on self motivation. These instructors and TA's can guide us and teach us and they'll be there along the way to walk us through but 99.99% of learning is going to come from putting in the time and effort. The TA's and instructors have been available when I need them and stay behind after class for hours as well as offer office hours throughout the week to come to them when we have problems. It's true that most of the staff is employed full time outside of this course but it hasn't restricted my access to them.Â Throughout the course we have been asked to provide feedback through weekly surveys. I provide this feedback but not to the detail that I am expressing on this website. I felt compelled to write a review because it's important that any potential students understand what they can expect from this course. Biased reviews by students that aren't placing 100% effort into the course should not prevent aspiring programmers from jumping on this opportunity.Â Â ,547,0
UT AUSTIN,TRILOGY,7/7/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    Austin ,,4,4,5,4,DISCLAIMER : This review is not final. I'll be returning upon completion of the course to provide a more complete feedback.At the time of this review we are currently halfway through the course.Â OVERALL EXPERIENCE : Thus far the bootcamp has been great! The course structure is built and designed as such to allow someone to have a full-time job whilst studying this course. Many other bootcamps are structured in a fully-immersive format. Had this bootcamp been fully-immersive and required me to quit my job I would not have signed up for it.Currently the vast majority of classes are being held at the Norris Conference Center off of Anderson Lane. While I have no complaints about the facility I do wish they would have kept it at the Joe C. Thompson building onÂ UT campus.Being that this isÂ class zero I fully expected there to be minor issues and/or changes along the way.Â CURRICULUM : The curriculum is for the most part fantastic. I do like how a curriculum change was made in the beginning of the course to replace Angular.js with React.js due to shifts in market demand as well as the fact that Angular was/is in development for a complete re-write for version 2.0.That said on more than one occasion they have had to combine two or more days worth of classes into a single day. This accelerates the learning curve to a point where you can have trouble grasping the concepts execution syntax usages and limitations of a given technology or method. This coming from myself after having spentÂ 15 months prior to this class self-teaching myself web development through various online resources. I can only imagine how lost some of the other students might feel if they've had no prior exposure to coding or web development.Throughout the earlier portions of the class I've had a lot of students ask me for help with the weekly homework/class assignments. Due to the pace of the class many if not all of the students spend more hours studying outside of the classroom then inside of it. I guarantee you will fail this class if you limit your study hours to classroom only.Â INSTRUCTORS : I wish I could rate this as a 6 out of 5 for the Monday/Wednesday instructors. I feel in part that the mixed reviews may be due to the different teaching methods and styles of the Tuesday/Thursday instructors. I'm in the Monday/Wednesday group and as such will refrain from commenting on the teaching styles and methods of the Tuesday/Thursday instructors.Â Our firstÂ instructor is Jim McCoy. He's been involved in web development since 2007 if I recall correctly. His sense of humor carries over into his teaching style andÂ I find his lectures easyÂ to follow along with. He'll freely admit when there's a method or concept he's unfamiliar with or a question that he feels he can't provide a satisfactory answer for.Our second instructor is Holly Springsteen. Involved in all things web dev since 2011 or so (Again going purely off of memory.). Her teaching style is succinct concise brief and to-the-point. Which works great when class time is limited and you have a lot of curious students asking questions to which detailed answers could take hours. She knows when to hand you off to google and when to sit you down in front of a whiteboard for a lengthy eplanation.Â Our third instructor is Rob Daly: He graduated from a bootcamp himself sometime within the past 2 years. And as such has a firsthand knowledge of challenges and/or concerns the studentsÂ have. The opposite of Holly when it comes to questions. I once asked him a single question about the React.js library which resulted in him spending 15 minutes going over the entire lifecycle of data in React.js.I could not have asked for better instructors.JOB ASSISTANCE : Job placement is not guaranteed upon completion of this course. Nor for that matter is the job assistance itself. You are required to maintain a 90% percentage in class attendance and homework submissions(Miss 3 homework assingnments within the 6 months of course material and they are under no obligation to provide job assistance).Â That being said Jeremy Bergerson our Career Director and Candace Salim our Student SuccessÂ Manager have been doing an excellent job. We have guest speakers from various companies all at least partially involved in Web DevelopmentÂ almost every Saturday. Some of the companies who have had a representative or speaker attend one of the Saturday classes thus far include IMB HomeAwayÂ JustOnePay StackOverflow Help.com and Data.World. (I'm sure there were a few more that I've neglected to mention.)Â Job assistance has not been a major focus of the course thus far. (remember we still have 12 more weeks.) I'll have to touch back on this in another 12 weeks.Â I'll be back.Â ,791,0
UT AUSTIN,TRILOGY,6/22/16,    Full Stack Flex ,    Austin ,,5,5,5,5,Hello everyone!I am a student in the 10th week of UTÂ Coding Bootcamp - I love it so far here's why:1. I really like my instructor Jim McCoy he makes learning fun and keeps the class engaged with humor. HeÂ explainsÂ concepts so well that those with little experience (me!) can still grasp the complicated subject matter. The teacher for the other class Roger Le is also a super knowledgable helpful academic staff member.2. They teach us real world application building using best in class tools like: git github sublime text heroku ghpages andÂ more.3. My classmates areÂ super involvedÂ sharing cool tools we find on our own and going above and beyond coursework requirements to learn as much as possible.4. I enjoy learning how to learn as a developer through extensive google searching. You kind of wonder why am I paying you so much money to learn how to google? But in reality this is what you'll be doing at work - and it's surprising how satisfying it is to figure out how to ask a question appropriately.5. The TAs I've interacted with: Holly Rob & Josh - all topÂ quality. They'll help you understand key concepts but won't hold your hand through the process so you learn how to learn on your own next time.6. Career director JB is amazing. He develops relationships with companies & individuals and delivers quality speakers networking opportunities and real world advice for finding a job after the program. I have been supremely impressed with his dedication.7. Last but not least - it's part time. I can keep my job (and keep my bills at bay...) while learning at night & on the weekends.I tried self study on sites like: codeacademy team treehouse and codeschool before enrolling in this course. My learning has accelerated tremendously since entering this class.We're only 10 weeks in and I am already comfortable with a wide variety of technologies like: CSS HTML Bootstrap JavaScript jQuery API research & integration Heroku Git Github etc.In conclusion I would just like to say that itÂ is not easy. You will have to dedicate large amounts of time outside of the class to study & learn on your own.If you aren't prepared to come early stay late and always be codingÂ - I wouldn't recommend it. But if you are ready to take the plunge this is a great pool to dive into.Good luck :)-Lisa,394,0
UT AUSTIN,TRILOGY,7/11/17,,,,2,2,1,2,Did I really just pay 10K for a review class? Because that's exactly what it seems like.Â This is an honest review: SAVE YOUR MONEY! Apologies in advance for the poor formatting!Â Â Teaching:The teacher is less a teacher and more of a ~facilitator. Facilitator in the sense that he was doing less teaching and more facilitating of slides/Â giving out assignments. TheÂ guidance was sub-par to say the least.Â -Often times the teacher wouldnâ€™tÂ show up on time for class when us students were out with our computers open ready to learn. How can you expect us students to come ready on time to learn and the professor shows up lateâ€_ I mean that'sÂ totally demotivating.Â Â -The teacher would rush through demos and not explainÂ the solutions in depth or at all for that matter!Â When asked a question he barely knew the information himself I might add that the TA seemed to know a bunch more than the teacher himself and also seemed to put in much more effort in supporting struggling students.Â For exampleÂ When a student asked a question the teacher would often stumbleÂ to find an answer and sayÂ heâ€™s gonna get back to you at a later point with the answer but rarely have I ever seen him follow up with an answer he just doesnâ€™t get back to youâ€_. that shows lack of initiative and lack of care.Â Above all I felt as thoughÂ the teacher failed to show genuine care as to helping us master these skills. It seemed as though he was just rushing through demos and examples without full in-depth explanations.Â Class:Â There are a lot of days when the whole class was us choosing a group to work with and working on one problem the whole day not going over it until the last 20 minutes of class or even the next day! From my calculations we are paying a couple hundred bucks a day for classâ€_ I understand working with others is a skill to develop but I didnâ€™t get much out of this.. especially when the correct ways to do things/ the answers are not properly gone over with in-depth explanations/ adequate time... I felt like I was paying to get assigned a coding problem and then just solve it with classmates who didnâ€™t know much more then I did so we didnâ€™t get very far or take away much.Â I genuinely feel robbed out of my hard earned money on top of student loans I now have 10K more of debtâ€_and for what?Â A disorganized curriculum with a professor that is always in a hurry to leave class and does not care about the students? A $15 Udemy course is FAR more valuable than this whole course. HANDS DOWN.Â Â Support:The support services are sub-par it's quite funny how they can even beÂ called support services! It's a marketing ploy to make the course look more attractive. There arenâ€™t any properly trained tutorsâ€_ the tutors are students that are either in the course or have completed the course.Â The career services support is a total joke as wellâ€_. There is a saturation of developers and its very difficult to get a job going to a boot camp does not make you any more attractive to employers at all.Â I wish the staff and people in general took the thousands of dollars studentsÂ spend on boot camps and education more seriously as we don't really have the thousands of dollars because most of all of us are already buried in loans of all kinds *~especially from education.Â I hope I shined some light for all of youâ€_. Again this is my honest review and it's how I felt about the course Iâ€™m sure others feel differently but I wanted to express my take as well.Â Â Thanks for reading!Â TL;DRHeed this advice and save your money! The University of Texas at AustinÂ barely has anything to do with this courseÂ it's actually done by Trilogy Education so donâ€™t get fooled about that because you canâ€™t evenÂ take advantage of UT Austin resources. Go to Udemy or any other online course and work through it yourself it's a far better (and cheaper) investment andÂ you will be thankful. I just wish I had taken this advice before I shelled out so much moneyÂ but I was lured and partly skewed by reviews here on this site so I wanted to give my take on it so maybe I can save some people in the future from falling into the trap I fell into.Â ,729,0

UT AUSTIN,TRILOGY,2/13/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Austin ,,3,3,1,1,My biggest hesitation on recommending this course is the lack of qualified instructors. I was surprised to learn that the course actually has no connection to UT it is designed and run by a company called Trilogy Education Services. So any associations you may want to attach to UT and itâ€™s educational standards are misleading. The instructors for these courses have no education training so there is a complete lack of pedagogy and when things get difficult to explain which they do often instructors are unable to break down the complexity and explain things in a way the class can understand. The curriculum is pre-written and instructors read off powerpoint slides word for word. Which results in the instructors not having a complete grasp on the concepts and lessons trying to be taught. The homework assignment are not real world examples we had to make lots of games. Which can be difficult to code but I was told I would learn real world examples of how to code. What I have told everyone who asked if they should take this course is NO. If I were to do it over I would spend about 6 months learning HTML/CSS and as much Javascript as I could online or from books. After you have these fundamentals I would take a course like this but not a full-stack course. I would take a front-end course or a back-end course and actually get good at something. If you are serious about your education and your investment visit a class and sit through a teaching session be critical and try your best to talk to students and get their honest feedback. Sadly I feel like I wasted my money on this course. I expected a course UT would indorse to be better.,297,0
NORTHWESTERN,TRILOGY,4/8/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Chicago ,,5,5,5,5,Going into this program I didn't know what to expect. I had some programming experience before but it was in an academic setting so I didn't have a reference point for a professional development program. What I ended up experiencing in this program was a model that worked. The curriculum was reverse-engineered from what employers expected their web developers to know. The approach to learning was hands-onÂ and project-based.From the start to the finish line we were running putting forward 110%. An important factor of this program was that it's a boot camp. So it was fast rigorous and challenging. Even though I was able to keep up with little struggle I was well-aware that my programming experience albeit limited gave me some advantage in keeping up with the material.Oh yeah and the instructor was one of the best instructors I've had in my life. He didn't just teach the material well he motivated and pushed us to be the best versions of ourselves. This level of support made the program worthwhile to me.Â Of course I came into this program hoping to switch careers after it completed. The career counselor was helpful and supportiveÂ in every step of the process-- from resume building to finding opportunities to mock interviews. He was good at what he did and made himself available to help students at any time they needed it (really any time of the day or year). He helped me get the job.The instructors and counselors made it clear that the more we put into the program and the job search the more we would get out of it. When it came down to supporting us and advising us they were there and really put in their time attention and care. However it was on me to do my part by completing the projects asking questions and trying hard to get the job. Would I recommend this program? If you can do it (and don't doubt yourself) then go for this program. You will get something out of it.,337,0
NORTHWESTERN,TRILOGY,3/11/17,,    Chicago ,,5,5,5,5,For anyone at any point in their student and/or professional career! (from zero background in coding to having experience) This is an amazing class because it's fun and very challenging. If you're ready to apply yourself and learn than this class will not only be a great experience but even more it will be great for your resume! TA's and Instructors are always there for you to help not to forget all the help form the careers team. The careers team is very very helpful! They coordinate hackathons one-on-ones your online presence technical resumes and more and more. A tonÂ of companies come in to talk meet and most importantly the chance to network as well!!I was fortunate enough to get a job while I was in this class and a I know other fellow students who were able to interview.Â Amazing!,140,0
NORTHWESTERN,TRILOGY,7/22/17,,    Chicago ,,5,5,5,4,The Northwestern coding boot camp was great. I think as with any course you take a lot depends on your teacher. Our set of Instructor and TAs were excellent. They were genuinely interested in seeing each student succeed and were always helpful. They dedicated a lot of time after class hours to help students and gave up much of their free time to share their knowledge and experience in extra help sessions. They were always motivating students to do better and were themselves motivated to teach.Â Career assistance was great too. They provided plenty of advice guest speakers and networking opportunities. Especially for those that have not had experience in web development the classesÂ on honing your resume and understanding how to present yourself and your portfolioÂ was a great help.This is a great choice for those that need to maintainÂ full-time work but would like to dive into coding. However you really only get what you put into it.,156,0
NORTHWESTERN,TRILOGY,3/6/17,,,,4,5,5,5,I took this bootcamp with absolutely no coding background but an interest in the coding/ IT world.Â I think you can be successful in this class if you are willing to put in the hours of time to keep up. The pace is FAST. This is a BOOTCAMP. You probably will not grasp every concept. If you hold on and do the work to keep up the best you can you will have a wonderful experience and learn more than you ever thought possible in 6 months.The paceÂ of this class is very VERY fast. I've felt confused almost the entire way so far. Granted I am only a few weeks in but my head is still spinning. It gives you a very quick overview of lots of different languages and their uses. A few months in you will be able to write some basic websites.Â Although I didn't get to use the career resources to it'sÂ fullest (I got a new code-related position only a few months into the bootcamp!) the resources I've been given have been spectacular. My career coach was willing to meet and stratagize with me from day one. He has been so helpful and followed through completely- with a willingness to offer help every step of the way.Â This bootcamp has been awesome despite the VERY fast pace. The other students are wonderful instructor has real-world experience and is funny and engaging the teaching assistants are the absolutely best. The resources are there for you but you need to be willing to reach out and use them! The student success manager is always available and willing to help.Â I highly recommend this class if you're a quick learner and have six months to completely devote to this program.Â Â ,287,0
NORTHWESTERN,TRILOGY,3/4/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Chicago ,,5,5,5,5,I work in the financial services industry and enrolled in this bootcamp in order to gain a better understanding as to how the underlying technology that runs this industry functions.Through this course I was exposed to numerous Javascript libraries that unexpectedly allowed me to build tools for my company and clients to manage and mass analyze data from silo'ed data sources - doing things above and beyond the scope of my job.For example I learned how to request financial market data through various APIs join the data with proprietary data run calculations (through Javascript code and libraries that I was exposed to in class) and store / access the data and calculation results through MongoDB. Prior to starting this course I would have assumed that this task was 'impossible' or could only happen if our technology team were engaged to scope / deliver the project. Instead I am now able to do things like this during \'down time\' at my job - I truly didn't know what I didn't know before I enrolled in this bootcamp.,176,0

GEORGIA TECH,TRILOGY,8/26/17,    Web Development ,    Savannah , LinkedIn,5,5,5,3,This course allowed me to better understand the application used on a daily basis. I built a strong background learning how to install and configure computers and with this program I now understand how they all work. I was nervous at first but the instructors were all great and I do not regret my decision. The Career advisors could do a little better with students and properly assiting them but again the program itself will alone help you. Building and creating are both ways to not only explore information but to instill real world applications that showcase and are used on a glabal scale which is pretty amazing considering. Great overall experience.Â ,112,0

GEORGIA TECH,TRILOGY,8/27/17,    Web Development ,    Savannah ,,4,4,5,0,I Personally like the codeing BootCamp.But its very stressfull sometimes if you have a family and things go by preety fast before you can master it.Â  As a former Game developer 6 years ago i practice codeing C# and soon after i learn what i wanted to learn i drop it. Returing to a codeing bootcamp make you realize how much little you know. Which is a great thing because everyday you are constantly learning new things and i love it.If your intrested in learning code and going to a Bootcamp please do two things first...1. Learn as much as you can before the program start! And 2. know how to concentrate focus and retain infomation! Because this couse is on a deadline and its not waiting for you to catch up.Take CareÂ Â ,133,0

GWU,TRILOGY,8/11/17,    Full Stack Flex ,    Arlington , GitHub,5,5,5,5,"I am a little over halfway through the 24 week full stack web developmentÂ boot camp.Everything has been great and I have received a lot of support.	Before enrollingÂ I was wary of the boot camp model. I did a lot of research and talked to two friends who went to GW. I wanted toÂ make sure this wasÂ legitimate. My fears were unfounded. This has turned out to be aÂ worthwhile experience.My section (about 20 students) meets Monday and Wednesday nights 6:30 - 9:30 PM. There is another section on Tuesday and Thursday nights 6:30 - 9:30 PM. Both sections come together on Saturday 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM. Saturdays are usually focused on group projects and breakout activities.Periodically I have had to switch from a Wednesday night to a Thursday night and it has worked smoothly. The students and instructor in the other section are welcoming and supportive.I usually attend in person. Hoever some people usuallyÂ attend remotely via the live video feed. If we are going to do a group project they encourage us to attend in person.Most of my classmatesÂ areÂ younger than me but they have been very welcoming.Each week I work 40 hours at my job attend 10 hours of boot camp classes and do 10+ hours of studying and homework. There is so much to learn that I could spend 20+ hours on studying and homework. I wish I had more time. The homework and projects areÂ not easy butÂ I have learned a lot.I cannot think of anything that the boot camp could do to improve.",253,0
