In the 3 months I was with them the instructor taught us everything we needed to know and more. GA does a spectacular job of providing support to its students and creating a fun and lively ambience for students to learn. I highly recommend the course to anyone who wants to learn web development.",70,0

GENERAL ASSEMBLY,NON-TRILOGY,8/10/2017,    User Experience Design (Part-time) ,    Sydney , LinkedIn,5,5,5,0,"I've worked in the digital industry for 15 years but was feeling a bit flat. I finally had the headspace (after having 2 kids) to start thinking about my career again and wanted to fill in the gaps and get up to speed. That was my intention... but what happened exceeded expectations. I had used the 'tools of the trade' before and had even freelanced as a UX designer. But this course gave me a better understanding of the WHY and HOW to turn all the bits of information into actionable insights and using that to inform the design process. It was challenging and empowering to break old habits and to focus so much energy on making sure you are solving the 'right' problem before allowing yourself to move into solution mode. Seeing classmates go through their own 'aha' moments was really interesting as was the breadth of final presentations and hearing all the challenges and pivot moments. We had an extremely supportive group of teachers teaching aids and classmates. Two months on and I am loving my job. Applying the 'process' of UX to my current work has been immensely satisfying and achieving much better results. Instead of using the 'tools' in an ad hoc manner I have the confidence to communicate the entire process as part of risk management and get more engagement from stakeholders. Instead of being reactive when somebody tells me they need a solution that does XYZ I can use the UX language to find out more about the 'suspected problem' so we can move through the various stages to make sure we are solving the right problem before we even start thinking about the solution. I could go on and on. ",282,0
GENERAL ASSEMBLY,NON-TRILOGY,7/22/2017,    Product Management Immersive ,    Sydney , LinkedIn,4,4,4,3,"A well run course pitched primarily at the entry level for Digital Product Managers.  The presenter did a great job of presenting the key principles in a fresh and lively manner and illustrated many key points with some real world examples.  The class members were energetic fun and made solid contributions to learning for everyone.  Final group project added an extra dimension to learning and it was practical and fun.  A great way for me to get a refresh on some key Product Management principles and upskill on more digitally focussed areas. ",92,0

I previously had a job in community relations but felt uninspired by my day-to-day (I just hated it). I tried out some free resources on Codecademy and applied to several bootcamps. After checking a few out I liked the campus and curriculum at General Assembly the best.About two years later - no regrets. I love programming and GA gave me what I needed to do this as a career! My teachers were fantastic passionate and gifted with coding and educational chops. It was VERY stressful at times but I loved working together with my classmates to get to \'the next level\' so to speak.My only note is that I had a job lined up before graduation so I don't have experience with the career coaching so much.",135,0

The program consists of learning the process of data analysis and practical skills to perform data analysis. Nowadays for online business marketing & data analysis tend to become a one-person job as campaigns can be optimised in real time based on their performances. This program gives you a set of skills that aren't taught at the university if you studied broad subjects like marketing or business.The theoretical part was very useful for me to understand what is the best approach before to do a specific analysis. How to prepare the business questions and choose a data set.Then we did many exercises using Excel SQL Tableau to learn how to leverage those tools to make the analysis and provide great data insights.What makes me satisfied is that I could use at work the next day what I had learned at night. I also met interesting passionate and motivated people. In my group there was people from many industries (Finance online business offline business ...). ",169,0

GENERAL ASSEMBLY,NON-TRILOGY,1/5/2017,    Data Science (Part-time) ,    Sydney , GitHub,5,4,5,4,"The Data Science course at GA was excellent!As anyone who has any prior knowlege of the field would expect the curriculium is quite broad and as a result the part-time course does not go in depth in any areas but rather takes you through the basics in as many areas as it can in 10 weeks. I imagine the full-time course would provide a more conclusive education but i can't really comment on that.Even though I would not recommend the part-time course to people looking for a conclusive education it was invaluable to me and will be to people looking to explore the options available in the Data Science profession. The part-time course does not pretend to give you all the tools you need to succeed in the industry. Instead GA has clearly realised that would be cramming too much into too little time and have structured the course to give you a good introduction to each area of Data Science and provide you with enough information to get you started on your own educational journey.This course will provide you with the basic knowlege of tools concepts and processes needed to get started with your own exploration and an excellent environment to ask questions and network with like-minded professionals.I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in getting started in Data Science but doesn't know where to start and what's involved.",233,0
GENERAL ASSEMBLY,NON-TRILOGY,8/20/2017,    User Experience Design Immersive ,    London ,,5,5,5,0,"I am a graduate of the User Experience Design Immersive Course in London from May-July 2017. I originally was on the February 2017 intake but had to pull out in Week 3 due to a sudden illness. While I was recovering in hospital they could not have treated me any better and offered me whatever options I wanted to take. I then re-started the course in May when I had recovered and am now in the job search phase of it. So far the job support has been quality and you are going to get out of it what you put in - but it's important to note that the support is there. The course itself is fast-paced full on and requires your 100% commitment - and I wouldn't want it any other way. We had an experienced senior UX Designer as our teacher and if we had any feedback we were constantly encouraged to speak up. It was a positive learning environment (but it did help that we had a classroom full of students that handled the pressure cooker well). If you are unsure about General Assembly - they are top notch and are worth the investment. But if you are deciding on a career change like I did make sure you go to the many free open nights and speak to the team there to see if it's right for you. And if it is - go for it!",235,0
GENERAL ASSEMBLY,NON-TRILOGY,8/10/2017,    Data Science Immersive ,    Washington ,,5,5,5,4,"General Assembly was a great experience for me and I would recommend it whole-heartedly. But you need to know what you're in for before you sign up. It's like a language immersion but for data. The data science immersive was very challenging because they're teaching you a ton of stuff in a very short amount of time. To get the most out of it you will be getting 8-hours of in-class instruction each day and should expect an additional 3-hours of homework after that to solidify the material you learned. Each day you learn two important topics related to data science (one in the morning and another in the afternoon). They don't really repeat things if you don't quite get it so you have to pay attention you have to do your homework and you have to not sweat the fact that you probably won't leave the course a total master at everything. If you come into the course with a bit of python as background that will help you immensely. If you do the work you will come out of the class with a solid data science foundation. You should know though that completing the course alone will not get you a job. You need to actually have the skills at the end as employers will test your abilities during the application process. You can't fake knowing data science. For this reason the job coaches can only get you so far. Think of this less as something you \'buy\' or \'get\' and more of something you \'do\' or \'work for\' and you should be able to get a lot from the class. If you don't have the right attitude the time or the discipline to learn the materials then this course is not for you.",296,0
GENERAL ASSEMBLY,NON-TRILOGY,8/9/2017,    User Experience Design Immersive ,    London ,,5,5,5,5,"I move to London for the UXDI Course and it's been one of my best decisions so far. The course was everything I needed and expected. I wanted to shift from Visual Design tu UX Design and GA gave me the skills and knowledge I needed. The 10 weeks are divided into different projects in groups and individualy. You have to work hard but at the same time you enjoy every single second that goes by. The Instructional team was very professional supportive and engaging all the way through.

GENERAL ASSEMBLY,NON-TRILOGY,8/2/2017,    User Experience Design Immersive ,    London ,,5,5,5,5,"I took the UXDI course in London early last year. My background had nothing to do with it I was working in a warehouse moving boxes here and there and working on weekends.Right after the course I got hired as a Teaching Assistant at GA London for the next UXDI which was an amazing experience and nicely paid which was great because I was broke :)I finished teaching on a Friday. The next Tuesday I started my first UX job at an agency in London. Now I just got offered another job with a great pay rise and better conditions. I went from 23K to 40K in year and a half. Pretty sweet. And no more lifting heavy boxes or working weekends.One thing though: The course is just the beginning you need to work hard during and after the course.

GENERAL ASSEMBLY,NON-TRILOGY,8/1/2017,    Web Development Immersive ,    London ,,5,5,5,5,"Hand on my heart I would recommend(with bright lovely colours)WDI to anyone who asks me. EnvironmentThe London campus is full of support laughter and fantastic vibes all of which mix very well for a perfect 12 week course. The front of house staff are exceptional and they maintain the campus to the highest standard. London hold superb events to which I have made a great deal of fantastic contacts from. The campus is in the heart of Aldgate and is surrounded by yummy food places and cheeky 'drink' places to kick back in. Instructors/ StaffThe instuctors at GA are on another level. Their complete expertese patience and support really help you feel like you can smash the course (with hard work). They are not only supportive but they are honest too if you're not pulling your weight during the course which for me is vital. The outcomes team who help you through the course with your job search are outstanding. They go above and beyond to help you find that first job after the course. The patience they have for each and every student is one of the reasons I would reccomend the course and the London campus. CurriculumGA's curriculum was a part of the course I was completely blown away with. We were all told from day one that the course would be full on and that basically you wouldn't have a life but the way they structured the course was perfect. I understand now that the WDI course will be moving to React as part of the curriculum which for me is the absoloute right direction. OverviewOverall I would give GA 9 out of 10. Anyone who is looking to step into the exciting pond of development would be utterly over the moon with this course. Putting the price of the course aside this for me was a complete investment. So much love for GA ",312,0
GENERAL ASSEMBLY,NON-TRILOGY,7/19/2017,    Web Development Immersive ,    London ,,2,2,4,3,"A friend recommended this course and found it really great. However there were only 16 people in their class - there were 30 in mine. I felt sorry for the tutors having to deal with a large group of students with such a diverse range of skill and needs - They were actually quite good but getting their attention was difficult. The pace of the classes was greatly affected by the wide range of skill levels and the number of students. With regards to our projects there were a few times where tutors would take over and basically do our code.I felt mislead by this course. Firstly because the website implies that there's a daily structure - a period of time designated to labs etc. Secondly that there would be pair programming. We didn't have many opportunities to do any labs and experiment and speaking to graduates from Makers pair programming really helped them progress and learn.I would only recommend this course if you have a solid foundation in coding already or have a STEM background. Before joining I was led to believe that you didn't need much experience and that everything will eventually click into place. 4 months on and I'm still waiting for things to fall into place. I can now see why Founders and Coders are very strict with their entrance requirements - as it pays to be prepared as you can before an intensive 3 months of learning.  ",240,0

GENERAL ASSEMBLY,NON-TRILOGY,7/6/2017,    Android Development Immersive ,    New York City ,,4,4,5,4,"General Assembly was an overall great experience. I came into the course with previous experience programming particularly with Java and that was definitely a great help. I feel that the course gave me an excellent solid foundation with Android fundamentals. I was also able to put together a decent portfolio of projects that I'll be able to continue to develop as I learn new skills.As far as career assistance goes General Assembly put me in a good place to help myself get a job. I have a personal portfolio website hosted by github a complete Linkedin page and an up to date resume. I also maintain access to the carreer assistance program for as long as I need so long as I am actively applying for jobs and regularly attending networking events.I am currently actively looking for jobs and there are certainly a lot of options in the New York City area. The only issue is that most postings ask for 2+ years of professional development experience with at least a year of Android development. This is a tough requirement for any recent graduate of a program that teaches a new skill but can be particularly tough for someone who is switching careers from a non-technical background.TL;DR: I recommend the program. Previous programming experience is not required but helps. Career assistance helps you help yourself.",225,0

GENERAL ASSEMBLY,NON-TRILOGY,5/19/2017,    Data Science (Part-time) ,    London ,,1,1,1,1,"I cannot describe how disappointed I am. I partly blame my own judgement. The curriculum looked very attractive with all the topics I hoped to learn. But if you think about it - they promise you to become a data scientist in two months with two 3-hour lectures a week? Common! I totally understand that the course would cost more if you extended it but this is exactly why I will not recommend it to anyone who asks me for advice. In the end it feels like I wasted my money. I'd prefer to pay more and learn properly than pay less and pretend learning.They could probably save the situation if they put more support in place. But support was not there. For money you pay you expect someone there to help you when you are stuck with your code or understanding and interpreting models. But no you are basically alone! In the end I found all answers I needed interacting in stackoverflow.com and learnt how different models really worked watching youtube videos by some prominent universities.The structure of the course and the pace are also totally wrong. We were asked to start working on a final project on week 3 before we covered all the topics. No feedback whatsoever! So instead of practising useful skills playing with modelling etc. students ended up fighting bad data sets and working on tasks which were unrealistic.So if you ask me - don’t waste your money. You will get the same knowledge elsewhere for free. Or if you have more money and time do it properly.",261,0

Overall I had an excellent experience. Pros:-my instructor Chandler was awesome. So knowledgeable very engaging up in front of the class (tough to do-- 3 hours x twice a week x 10 weeks) always available to help with projects outside of class and also a fun guy outside of class.  Our TAs were also incredibly helpful. -my classmates were so cool. There were a lot of designers in my class who were looking to get more technical and I loved making friends with them. Also some ppl in adtech and some ppl with more traditional IT jobs looking to expand their skills. We went out for drinks as a class a few times and I've kept in touch with some ppl professionally. -the space. The campus is awesome and very well located. Cons:-Chandler did a great job organizing all the content so I knew where to find everything but I think he built the website where he organized everything himself so I don't think other teachers' classes materials are as well organized. -I wish there had been a little more time built into class for the students to get to know each other.

GENERAL ASSEMBLY,NON-TRILOGY,3/31/2017,,,,3,2,2,4,"My experience on the London WDI course at GA was very mixed and hard to say if I would recommend it to anyone or not and I will try my best to explain why. I shall first start off with the Pro's of doing the course then get onto the Con's. I finished the course a few months ago so have had time to process my experience and to then see how it prepared me for the outside job hunting world. So Pro's:The overall feel and atmosphere of the campus was really enjoyable. It has a nice little homework area where you can hang out and work after lessons and it does not feel sterile. So after a long day of coding you can move to a more relaxing state if you need. All of the staff were approachable and it had a real sense of community. I had never been in a place where I had gotten along with everyone there and for this reason i loved GA. It thrives a relaxed learning population. Also the social side of the GA is pretty big and there are lots of drinks involved.The other main Pro is that the tutors at GA put effort into teaching you. They stay every night to help till around 10pm then come in on the weekends to help during projects too and it never once felt like they didn't want to be there. The other students were all lovely which is great as GA promotes pair coding which is great.I also would have to say that I did learn a lot of coding information and terms.. and I say \'information and terms\' as I picked up a lot of .... Con's:I did NOT learn in depth javascript or other languages which I thought was a very important thing to pick up in a three month coding course. But instead of going in depth in javascript we skimmed that then skimmed jQuery then skimmed AngularJS etc etc till we had covered many different technologies but never focused a lot on one to pick it up properly. This in tern made me aware of all these things and gave me some small understanding but left me not understanding fully how to even write Javascript or anything else from scratch.We were told to copy code a lot of the time and when I would ask what parts of the code did i just got told to copy it and I did not need to understand what it did. There was not a lot of code checking and feedback of progress. Was rare that I had the tutor look through my code properly and give me feedback or in depth help. The tutor would sometimes take my laptop and do the coding for me on parts therefor leaving me without the knowledge but with working code this happened a lot and it felt like I was just being given four projets to take to interviews but was very concerned that if i got asked about the code I could not answer the questions as a lot of it was not my work. (also a lot of other students work from group project weeks).So given the above you would think that I would not recommend but i think that GA messed up this one time.Basically our class was the biggest one and there were too many students per tutor. Way too many to get proper help which is proabably why i got told to copy a lot. They do not have classes this big after us i don't think. Also we had a tutor that was new to teaching and did not do a good job. We would not pick up entire lessons through this reason. That tutor is no longer there. The course was trying a new structure that did not work. Our homework was not a natural flow from the work in the day and we felt like nothing flowed and a lot of the time was confused about the structure of learning but they have now realised what they did wrong and the newer classes seem to be working well again. So if we were just an unlucky class and now they have less students more time to help one on one and the structure is sorted I would strongly recommend GA. But this may be an up and down process so cannot say for sure.I'll leave by saying outcomes really do try hard to find you a job after and if you do the work they will do everything they can to help you. There is a lot of support after leaving and I was one of the lucky ones that landed a job very quickly after leaving.So GA does get you work after!! As always if you put the hard work in no matter what you will get there. :) ",805,0

Our instructor worked at YikYak and the TA was from a data team at Turner so it was really interesting hearing from both how they used those tools in their daily work. I felt supported on topics that were challenging to me and I was always able to dig deeper into areas that felt a bit easier.

For me I have learned more than expected. I have alwlays felt that the more you know the more you don't know. The course left me wanting to dive deeper and just keep going and that is a very exciting feeling! The instructors go way beyond their duty to help because they truly care. Dave once stayed till almost 8pm to help me with scrapy. During capstone days Kiefer spent well beyond 34 hours with me a day when I was behind. They are always availabe during and even after the course was over to help whenever I have questions. They follow up on my questions and provide additional materials for further study. Now I'm a TA and get to be involved with some of the course planning. I have even more appreciation of how hard the intrustors and the entire production team work to make the course go smoothly. Staff at GA are super friendly. Outcomes was helpful but I feel we could use more partnership. That said I got my internship through an on-site interview from GA. I have also met amazing peers in my program some has become life-long friends. People's background was diverse and we support each other to learn. Since we are all adults everyone is super motivated and that created a great environemnt. Our TA continue to hold review sessions and interview preps after the course is over.

GENERAL ASSEMBLY,NON-TRILOGY,2/1/2017,,    London ,,1,1,1,1,"This is one of worst and most over-priced courses in London. I decided to take this course as it shows a solid content structure including a project development over a 10-week period rather than the whole UK digital marketing course market which are based on 2-day or 1-week workshop courses.Learning online optimization is really difficult due to you cannot monitor and expect immediate results as it is a long process and significant self-study time-investing to dominate it. So why did I pay for a course if anyone can learn FREE surfing online?I said to myself “I have no time to spend exploring and learning digital skills by my own so I need to pay for the best time-effective learning experience so I can apply knowlege efficiently & immediately”. So I made a big effort to enroll to this course as It has similar cost than university fees almost 3000 pounds and over this if you take a funding option.What a disappointment!! I feel legally scammed!!! The course is simply REALLY BAD as It is running as it was a 1 day-workshop basis i.e. the explanation is broadly and over-exploratory and backed-up for links to check. Therefore During a 10-week period the course should have focused in learning quickly how to perform all minimum procedures requested to execute a digital marketing strategy but this course does not do it because does not teach you fundamental steps to execute procedures.For example there is a SEO chapter where it must be taught things as how to perform effectively a keyword research or competitive analysis. All you have is an overview chat and a link to a 1000-page book to learn!!!! Or the Google Adwords lesson is pure theory you never can put an Ad if you do not have a site which a previous Ad movement. SThe course dynamics consists on an online pre-work (which is mostly run for a self-corrected software) a 2 x two-hour lesson per week and a weekly homework. The homework is based on the project but It is not corrected weekly so you could have done a lot of work for nothing as It may be wrong….this is not time-effective learning method at all.The course teachers are a team: one is a field professional another one is a class assistant and a coordinator (you will never see her/him in the course so omit her/him). I cannot criticize their professional knowledge about the study field but they clearly did not have a good understanding of how to deliver the content syllabus of the course making the learning experience deficient.They do not revise course materials prior lessons as they just copied slides for another past course at other GA branch. Therefore there are several contents that are not updated or simply they do not know to operate some tools indicated at the syllabus. In my opinion is an excessive relax approach to a teach a lesson it is ok for a class to have a kind of fun environment with some music but I am not satisfied to pay to see teachers take it easy.The project is another joke as there is not a project!!!! it is only a slide presentation about how It should be developed the project!!! This is really poor as IStay away for this course that clearly is not worthy for what is teaching with the same money find a 1-on-1 education or pay for an internship to a professional agency you will learn more and will have a better material for CV purposes. This course is not going to give you a real life-change career or help you how to execute a correct digital marketing to your business.  ",613,0

GENERAL ASSEMBLY,NON-TRILOGY,1/8/2017,    Data Science Immersive ,    San Francisco ,,5,5,5,4,"The data science immersive course at General Assembly was an awesome mind-expanding and super enjoyable experience. The curriculum is industry relevant and very practical taught through both formal style lectures as well as hands on in class assignments and outside homework and capstone project. The course is definitely intense and fast-paced you'll be writing code and learning all day long so expect to work hard but have fun too! In my cohort we started with learning python fundamentals and quickly learned much more advanced techniques as well as some object-oriented programming. From there the course dives into foundational predictive modeling techniques like regression analysis and continues to build in complexity with more contemporary machine learning and big data topics. The instructors I had (David Yerrington and Kiefer Katovich) are exceptional teachers — highly experienced professionals who clearly love what they do. They were able to make very challenging topics approachable and highly engaging motivating me to push myself outside my comfort zone and learn way more than I had ever expected in only three short months. I also can’t stress enough how much I learned from my fellow classmates even if it was just learning from their mistakes! But real talk: Data Science is a broad field so you won’t learn In terms of career support even as a seasoned professional any job search has it's challenges. GA does a decent job of helping you with your resume job search strategy and some interview prep but at the end of the day it’s up to you to find a job you’ll be happy with. Having said that since completing the course I have had several recruiters reach out to me completely unsolicited regarding analyst and data science positions.

GENERAL ASSEMBLY,NON-TRILOGY,1/5/2017,    Android Development Immersive ,    Austin ,,4,5,5,5,"I'm leaving this review for anyone considering the Android Development Immersive. I don't know much about the other courses offered by GA except that if you want the highest chance of getting a job you should take the Web Development Immersive for reasons I'll explain later in this review.As things are now if you really want to take this course and are able to comprehend a very basic amount of html for the code challenge required before your interview you will be admitted. Honestly if you are willing to get a loan or pay for this course you are obviously serious about learning this skill. I came into the program with very basic prior experience in mobile development and the coding languages used. This would be my recommendation for others considering I am one of the two students out of five in the class that has a job 100+ days after graduation. The other student with a job also had some prior experience with Java which is the main language used for Android development. They will let you into the course without any prior knowledge and suggest that you take a Java primer before starting but I would think hard about going through an online course beforehand. There are so many free resources out there there's really no reason not to learn as much of the basics as you can before you start to this expensive course.One of the biggest obstacles to learning to develop software is getting over the hurdles of beginning to learn a new language. I went through all the hair-pulling beforehand of just wrapping my head around coding languages and object-oriented programming structures. You don't want to have this struggle coupled with the logic learning and architecture you have to learn as well during the course. Having some prior knowledge allowed me to consume the course material at it's very fast and condensed pace.The course material itself is still being perfected and tested at the time of this review but that does not mean it is not effective. I have been able to secure a position at a large and growing development company that handles apps for clients with 10+ million user bases. I count myself very lucky and I have worked very hard during the 12-week course and the 100 or so days after that it took me to get hired.What really helped in regards to the actual course material was having two amazing instructors. GA hires professionals who have proven themselves in their field and this really allows for practical real-world-applicable learning that is hard to get in a college classroom. These instructors know the ins-and-outs of the industry and the resources you need to always be up-to-speed on what's happening in the developer community.GA also has a well-developed structure and connections to get you involved in the community (at least at the Austin location) which is another major reason the program was effective.After the course we were given job assistance but since the ADI is so new GA is still working on solidifying relationships with companies that need Android developers. As I alluded earlier this is one of the reasons WDI students get jobs so quickly and at high percentages (the WDI program has been around much longer and GA has much deeper roots with companies in this field). Don't let this deter you too much though because the job hunt really is on you and GA didn't completely leave us hanging. To further our education GA set up each student with mentors (in our case two each because of our small class size) who are senior developers at major companies in Austin. This is how I got connected with my current job and gained some very important insight into becoming a professional and contributing developer. Use the mentor program as much as you can. This is how you raise your skill level exponentially after graduation and can compete against others with years of experience.It is possible to succeed with this program and you can do it if you really want it. It's all on you though and of course nothing is guaranteed. But GA is good about doing their best to give you what you need to succeed. Many people take their courses for a reason just be prepared to work very hard for it.",708,0

I can't tell you how valuable I found this during the class and after. You would see the benefits of this manifest in a number of ways including: students forming study groups to work through labs and homework team happy hours after class groups going to networking events including conferences and meetups together and even having study sessions and interview prep whiteboarding practice together.

You can read my mushy love letter to them on medium here: https://medium.com/@bryonymc/a-love-letter-to-my-programming-school-d8cd2f9332bf#.dxdl24xebbut to highlight some key points for future bootcampers to help you with your search: Find a school that embodies the environment you aim to work in post-graduation. Like follows like and if you want to work at an open accepting company with a work hard play hard mentality than you should find programs that match that culture. During my search I found a few schools that seemed great on paper but all their photos showed a bunch of men staring at screens in a sad cramped office...why? Despite a fluke* of being the only woman in my cohort I still found that the type of people drawn to GA are more diverse more open-minded and creative and therefore more supportive - which is what you want when you're halfway through the course and rethinking all your life choices. *Don't underestimate the importance of complementary portions of the program. (1)(2) *Special noteResearch your instructors backgrounds. You want instructors who understand current trends in the industry. Work experience in the industry is vitally important (they've been on the frontlines) but also making sure they understand that the tech industry changes every day...so the languages they programmed in a year ago are no longer relevant. There are people in every industry who try to insist that the knowledge they have is still important despite it gradually becoming obselete. You don't want these people as your instructors - they won't teach you the skills or languages you need to be current with today's jobs. At GA they are all about updating the curriculum to match current/future trends (for example my cohort spent two weeks on React whereas the group before spent more time on Ruby and the next one is learning Python). You want a school that adapts and grows with the industry and instructors who can do the same (happily not begrudgingly). I had two bad-ass teachers The staff at GA Austin is also awesome and provided that external support in hosting happy hours and fun opportunities for bonding (friends-giving! halloween party! oh my!).

GA gave me the opportunity to learn a set of skills that are marketable but it has also given me a support system. My instructors are my friends my classmates are my friends and the alumni are my friends. I was blown away when I realized that even though I've graduated I can still be an active part of the GA world. My job assistance help has been phenominal as well. I simply can't understand how one woman is able to assist so many people at one time but she does it. And the help she offers is catered to each individual - it must be magic. To sum it up my experience has been very challenging but I have never been without support and encouragement. I haven't been handed anything but rather shown that I can do it myself with hard work and determination. ",178,0
GENERAL ASSEMBLY,NON-TRILOGY,12/1/2016,,,,5,4,5,4,"The Web Development Immersive at General Assembly SF was a life-changing experience for me and really what I needed to make my dream become a reality. To begin with the space is beautiful and conducive to creativity. The instructors and other staff were always extremely kind and helpful. The curriculum was in-depth expansive and pragmatic. We covered core material through the full-stack and also gained valuable knowledge in the interview process data-structures/algorithms teamwork documentation etc. GA's positive atmosphere attracts great students that I am most glad I had the chance to work with. I think the WDI at GA was such a good fit for me because of the preparation I had done before looking into it. I had already been teaching myself the fundamentals of programming and front-end web development beforehand. The course moves fast; the prior knowledge made it manageable for me to pick up new things quickly debug on my own and taught me where to look when I got stuck. Also before GA I was meeting with people in the field to build a strong network I could reach out to when I finally did have the necessary skills. Through this I was able to get interviews right after graduation from GA and was hired in a software developer position within a few weeks. However without our WDI lessons on interviewing using new libraries and take-home coding challenges ---- I doubt I would have performed well!If you are looking into bootcamps I would highly suggest GA. But I think (pretty much for all bootcamps) you should definitely take a lot of time teaching yourself first; there's lots of free online resources (I'd recommend Udacity courses). For a beginner I'd say before applying to GA ---- a consistent 20hrs a week of learning on your own for 3-4 months can do wonders for your experience. During that time you can also read up on the field go to lots of meetups and grab coffee with people in jobs you're interested in. Regardless though GA has strong curriculum amazing instructors and a dedicated outcomes (jobs) team. If you are just beginning to code you will still have lots of assistance with the lessons and career development throughout the course. However the more prepared you are coming in ---- the more exponentially your skills can grow and the faster you can achieve your dream.  ",388,1
GENERAL ASSEMBLY,NON-TRILOGY,11/29/2016,,    London ,,1,1,1,0,"   My company signed me up for this course so that I could pick up some SQL and Tableau skills but I think I went in knowing more than the instructor already.She had never even done a read through of the course ppt and was surprised at things that would come up. She was unsure how to problem solve even small issues that came along and if you asked her anything that wasn't right there on the screen she would tell you to just google it. Further the administration is poorly run and took 4 months to return my deposit and only did so after I chased over 5 times.My company is looking to train more people in Tableau and the one thing I tell them is to NEVER send anyone to GA.",131,0
GENERAL ASSEMBLY,NON-TRILOGY,11/25/2016,    Web Development Immersive ,    San Francisco ,,5,5,5,5,"I decided on a career change in my early 30s when I was unhappy with my career in the medical field. I had done some simple HTML and CSS in the past and so I decided to take General Assembly's part-time Front-End Web Development night class while I was working full time.  Though it was a difficult schedule I am glad I decided to ease myself into learning the basics of Javascript HTML and CSS at the time. I decided to quit my job a month later and begin the Web Development Immersive course a full-time intensive bootcamp that lasts about three months. I took out a private loan and several credit cards in order to finance my studies and life for that period of time. There's a reason they call it a \'bootcamp\' - it is very difficult time-consuming and fast-paced!  I was prepared for all of these things and I found General Assembly's community really helpful if I encountered any difficulties along the way.  Fellow students were open kind and encouraging. Teachers were AMAZING - incredibly knowledgeable supportive and genuinely nice people. The curriculum was well-formed and organized and I was lucky to have the same organized knowledgeable and helpful course producer (Mercedes) from my part-time Front-End course.  I felt that the outcomes (how to get a job after the course) was well organized and catered to most of the students who didn't have any experience with things like writing a technical resume and making yourself look like an excellent candidate on LinkedIn.You will get out what you put in. I studied 7 days a week and used many outside resources (both online and buying books on JavaScript) to help me get the in-depth knowledge I knew I'd need to show that I was competent enough to be an entry-level software developer.  After graduating I realized what benefited me most by taking the course was the group projects. When learning programming on your own it's rare to be able to work on a team on GitHub or to use git to the extent you do in the real world. GA's procedure of making everyone learn how to work together on a development project introduced me to how I'd be working and interacting with future coworkers.  It took me approximately 75 days after graduating to get my first contract and I got my second contract a week after that!  I landed at that second job and I've been working there for three months now and I absolutely love it. The job hunt:  It is stressful it's hard. The days and weeks after graduation are even more difficult and grueling than the actual bootcamp. I applied for literally hundreds of jobs contacted so many hiring managers and lead software developers on LinkedIn and other places and I received so many rejections - too many to count! But I stuck with GA's Outcomes planning and documented everything I did and took advantage of all of the after-graduation meet-ups talks etc to ensure I was networking to the fullest extent.  In addition I was always on a new project. I refactored my first GA project and then moved on to teach myself new JavaScript frameworks on my own.For me it was a sacrifice of time and finances but I feel I used the resources GA made available to every student to the greatest extent I possibly could and that made all the difference and my life is entirely different and 100% better than it was just a year ago!",586,0
GENERAL ASSEMBLY,NON-TRILOGY,11/18/2016,    Product Management Immersive ,    San Francisco ,,5,5,5,4,"I took the full time product management immersve and it was a great jumping off point for my career in product. Getting a PM role can be very difficult but under the guidance of my instructors who were season product people themselve I landed a role six weeks after graduation. This is not to say that I got the role easily. Working hard in the course and getting prepped for job hunting with the resources at GA was key.",78,0
GENERAL ASSEMBLY,NON-TRILOGY,11/18/2016,    Web Development Immersive ,    New York City ,,2,1,1,1,"This program was a major financial setback. The price you pay does not match the quality you pay for. There is no set curriculum for each class I've sat in on an instructor meeting and they typically create it 2-3 weeks before the class launch. This causes a lot of unexpected errors to go in class and makes the whole experience lackluster. A lot of the instructors are past students who \'know\' the curriculum enough to teach it. The presentation of core concepts and fundaments was random. I did not feel like each class connected nor did I feel like my skills were developing throughout the 12 weeks. This did not feel like a classroom but more of a \'hangout\' spot. GA does a good job dressing up their facilities and portraying their environment as \'trendy/hip/techy\'. Although I did build good relationships with the people around me. Mostly because we all had common feelings about how GA was a waste of time.There were happy hours and hot UX/UI girls walking around all the time but that's pretty much it. You're giving a lot of false hope about becoming a developer from 12 weeks of irrelevant training. The saddest day for me was our Demo Day (graduation day) - there was so much promise of this being the big day for students to present to potential employers. Nope not even one it was all students.. parents.. instructors.. That point I knew I had took a huge financial burden yielding nothing but bits and pieces of knowledge.While I was applying to jobs I was laughed at by every employer. I was not prepared to handle the truth. It took me time to actually develop some skill but that was all on my own from using resources like udemy/treehouse/lynda.This is my honest experience at GA you guys are just another venture backed start up racking up the dollars from the rest of the world.  ",316,0
GENERAL ASSEMBLY,NON-TRILOGY,11/16/2016,    Front-End Web Development (Part-time) ,    San Francisco ,,5,5,5,5,"I decided to take the class after I was struggling to learn JS by myself. I needed some kind of structure to force me to be more serious about learning the language. I then decided to take this class. I couldn't have been happier to made that decision.From the first day to the last the class content was very engaging and practical. That is the key aspect of any educational program now: to teach you something that you can start using or be close to using as soon as you walk out of class. Avand Amiri our instructor was probably one of the best instructors I've had in my entire life. He was easygoing clear in the way he taught and always bringing his previous experiences with the ways he had used the concepts in the past (box-sizing flexbox stylesheets functions etc.). Every class I came out knowing something new and something that I could go back home to experiment with.If you are on the fence on whether to take a class or not you should go for it. Investing 6 hours for ten weeks will go a loooong way in helping you learn the most important language of the future: programming.",201,0
GENERAL ASSEMBLY,NON-TRILOGY,11/16/2016,,    San Francisco ,,5,4,5,4,"General Assembly was an incredible place to kickstart my digital marketing career.  I came from a start-up background where all aspects of digital marketing were more or less \'self-taught.\'  So it was the right place to learn the latest real-world concepts and trends and actually put them into action with colleages with really diverse experience. Keep in mind DM is such a broad skillset and the course is a good way to get an OVERVIEW and understanding of digital marketing.  I recommend it for people who want to know \'what's out there/where to go next\' as opposed to people who've already worked in the industry a couple years.  But overall it's a great experience and everyone's super welcome to an exchange of ideas and resources.  I took the DM course in Los Angeles and then became an instructional associate when I moved to San Francisco a year later.  You'll always get what you put into it--do the work ask for help get involved.  It's worth it!",164,0

I learnt so many new things and got some great ideas for generating leads. It was the first time the course had been run over a week. It was full on but really effective. The teachers were always available to assist me at any time. I have now taken on new ideas for our website and analytics and adwords. ",82,0
GENERAL ASSEMBLY,NON-TRILOGY,11/6/2016,,    Sydney ,,5,5,5,3,"I had such a great week building up my UX Design skills. The content was all industry based which means that I can apply it all to real life work and situations. It was great to have a class size of only 13 people which I think is optimal for being able to create a good classroom dynamic and the avaliability of two instructors (who created a wonderful working environment and enhanced the ability to share ideas) was also really helpful. Feedback was always taken on board and students were able to contribute to the direction of the class. ",99,0

I even had several spontaneous meetings with potential employers just from working on campus after the course. I've cut pages out of this review because I could go on and on about my great experience in UXDI6. ",128,0
