School, Date, Course, Location, Verified, Overall Exp., Curriculum, Instructors, Job Assistance, CommentsSCARLET KNIGHTS,8/9/2017,    Full Stack Flex - Full Time ,    Somerset , GitHub,5,4,5,4,I'll admit when I signed up at the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp I was real nervous. I was scared that I wouldn't have a great support system and I would just barely survive the bootcamp. However all those fears disappeared the second I walked into the classroom. There I was surrounded by great students and faculty who wanted nothing more than to create coders who were going to "crush it!" The curriculum is intense to say the very least but you're learning the basic foundations that you can continue to build off of. There was no stone left unturned with the amount of information that we absorbed.I loved coming to class every day and be surrounded by these incredibly ambitious and goal driven students. We really were a little family together. I know for a fact that all of us are going to remain in touch and be the biggest cheerleaders when it comes to finding a job.The only thing I wish I did prior to becoming a student was code a little bit more. You can totally join the boot camp having zero coding background but sitting down and taking basic courses on Udemy was really helpful to me. I just wish I had done more!  I absolutely recommend the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp to anyone who wants to change their lives and start a new career. 
SCARLET KNIGHTS,6/13/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City , LinkedIn,4,5,5,2,Before you read this write-up will be a bit too long this could be a mix of review overview and what to expect. If you're like me were admitted to the program had concerns and kept hunting for reviews a month before the class started I hope this will quell fears. It's understandable if you do its a lot of money and a huge investment but I'd do it again in a heartbeat. A lot of bootcamps expect you to quit your job to attend but RCB is held three days a week with hours that don't interfere with typical work hours which will be a plus for many.I attended the program in their Jersey City satellite location. My commute was about two and a half hours on a good day with public transportation from the Bronx but being right next to the PATH was extremely convenient.A little background on myself in case if there is someone who is reading is currently in the situation that I was in before I enrolled. I studied media studies but not too soon after graduating I realized the job market wasn't what I was expecting it to be for the field.I had a pretty good handle on HTML and CSS before starting the class as I had taken a few classes on them. When it came to JavaScript and everything else I had no idea about the technology that it took to make a website. Before I really took to dive I went through numerous tutorials and books to explore programming to see if it was for me. If you are highly considering programming as a career path and have no prior experience with code I suggest the following resources (in order of quality IMO):FreeCodeCampAdmissionsRutgers Coding Bootcamp wasn't the only program I tried to get into. I've applied to a lot and not every one of them has the same admissions process. Typically the higher-priced (or salary-based) ones have several rounds of coding tests and interviews. A lot of them were extremely daunting as they replicated the actual process of the application process for the typical programmer's position some of them even expected applicants to know recursion which baffled me. But applying to Rutgers was really pleasant compared to the other processes I went through. Some of them were so impersonal and demoralizing that I step away from coding for a few months.Rutgers started with a general info session with a Trilogy rep who gives you a run down of the program. Based on that conversation if you are ready the process starts and you'll have an interview with admissions. They'll take your background interest in the program and your experience with programming. From there you'll take an online multiple-choice assessment and then based on your score you'll have another interview session that's only slightly technical with a tricky logic question. It's worth noting that for every stage of the admissions process you'll be on the phone with someone which I did like since it added a human touch to it.After that it's only a few days before you get the final verdict. In all for me the process only took two weeks from speaking with an information rep to getting the decision and it was pretty painless.The Teaching StaffMy class was led by Peleke and Matt with Boris and Theory being the Teaching Assistants. These four are amazingly patient human beings who want nothing more than for you and your classmates to succeed. They will not only make learning code enjoyable and interesting they will teach you how to break down concepts remind you about the fundamentals and inspire you to push your brain to the limit. Don't hesitate to ask questions if you do they'll always have an answer. They are all very humble and empathetic and understand if you are having trouble picking up a concept they'll work tirelessly with you to make sure you are comfortable with it. They will go above and beyond to make sure that your projects are ready for deployment and bug-free even if it's into the wee hours of the night.With all of the terminologies and syntax it's hard to get a high-level understanding of things but with the program you'll have plenty of practice. Each class you'll have 10 or more activities that'll make use of each tech.But even if you are not assigned the same teaching staff I've had fear not as Trilogy is pretty good as sourcing their staff as they're all extremely knowledgeable and will pretty much have an answer to any question you throw at them.Your cohort is assigned a student success manager who is pretty much makes sure you're on track with your homework up to snub with the material provides info on the course and helps you get in touch with the various Trilogy Services. I haven't had to ask Kalimah for too many things but she was always great at helping me out and informing the class of changes and anything we need to do.The CourseThe program itself is excellent. The curriculum is finely tuned and top notch. For those who are concerned with only learning the newest and "hottest" tech and afraid that what you'll learn will be outdated have no fear. The curriculum team is constantly working on the course material and are always adjusting to what technology is in-demand at the moment like React JS. If somehow Vue JS becomes the next de-facto JavaScript framework I'm sure the team will adjust the curriculum to that. At the end of my cohort we were scheduled to spend a week (for each) on Java and Python but React JS had picked up so much steam we skipped those two and spent extra time on React.24 weeks sounds like a very long time but I didn't feel like it. Regardless of any program DO NOT expect that you will learn the in's and out's of any programming language. That is simply not enough time to master anything but it is enough time to get pretty good at something.The first 2 - 3 weeks you'll go through git and Github with a crash course in HTML and CSS. After that you'll get into JavaScript and jQuery. But right after that is where things pick-up with Node JS and the course starts getting interesting. By the end of the course you'll be comfortable with databases and frameworks like React JS.There is a homework assignment that's due two weeks from when it was assigned. Each homework assignment deals with the tech that is learned and you're given the option of doing assignments into difficulties one of them being the easier to do. In total there are three group projects which will expect you to make use of all the technology you have learned as well as incorporating anything not covered in class. These were extremely fun yet incredibly frustrating all for good reasons. They not only add to your portfolio but help you get a sense of how to work in a team version control and learn project management.Besides class time and work there are plenty of opportunities to learn provided by Trilogy throughout the 24 weeks. They do "hackathons" on a weekly basis typically on a Friday night where someone will teach a programming language not a part of the curriculum or go over something like React JS more in depth. These are done online with other cohorts alumni and teachers from other Trilogy programs around the country. They are really informative and voluntary so if you do have extra time outside of class work I definitely recommend doing them. They are recorded so if you miss them they are viewable once the videos are encoded and uploaded to Youtube.I haven't had to use them but Trilogy does provide tutoring services so if you do find yourself struggling with class work you can as for a 1-on-1 session and they are at no extra cost.Career ServicesDo not expect any sort of job placement from Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. From the very first day they will iterate that they do not have any sort of job placement program in place. They had workshops on how to build your online presence practice sessions for job interviews and webinars with industry folks. I had the impression that they were still ironing things out in their career service which is a real shame since the curriculum is quite excellent.While I didn't expect to be handed a job after graduation career services left a lot to be desired. There were tons of communication breakdowns or lack of. At times there were career service webinars scheduled during work hours which a lot of people couldn't attend. They did tell us for demo day/graduation that there was going to be a few hiring managers there to connect with but none showed up. Career service was kind of a mess but they were in the middle of a revamp I guess. It would be nice if they organized meetup-like events. There are opportunities outside of class to network in the area but it could be tough getting to recruiters and hiring managers at those.The TakeawaysTL;DR 
Overall based on the strength of the curriculum and the material you'll learn I can wholeheartedly recommend this program. Learning programming is very hard and it's easy to get into the notion that it's a breeze with bootcamps promising you to be a master programming in three months. The reality is you won't come out of any bootcamp as a master developer and you won't after completing this one. There is simply not enough time to learn everything. So with that programming is hard and the folks at Trilogy know this. Although career service wasn't the most robust aspect it shouldn't deter you from considering this program you'll learn a lot and have fun doing it. *****If you feel that this is the program for you or you've already been admitted and preparing to start here are some things I suggest on doing:PRACTICE and REPEAT:GOOGLE is your best friend:Throw your ego into the Hudson River: Help your classmates out:Go all in on projects and homework assignments:
SCARLET KNIGHTS,6/8/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City , LinkedIn,5,5,5,3,I am so thankful that I found Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. I needed a program near where I lived from a trusted and reputable source that allowed me to continue working. The structure of this program is ideal for those who cannot give the 60-80 hours/week required by many full-time bootcamps. Not only that the slower pace over a 24 week program aids retention of concepts and affords time to apply new concepts creatively. I continued learning concepts that a bootcamp does not have the time to cover and explored tech outside the curriculum. Since this bootcamp is connected with a larger organization Trilogy Education Services with bootcamps and several major universities across the US the coding community is strong and the opportunites to learn from one another are great. Pavan Katepalli is the CLO for the organization. He holds weekly training sessions and miniHackathons where I met students from other bootcamps and learned new concepts and technology outside the normal curriculum. Trilogy also provides free tutoring services for students who need assistance. I was able to begin tutoring other students while in the program and continue tutoring to this day.
SCARLET KNIGHTS,4/2/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Somerset , GitHub,5,4,5,3,undefined    This program was a lot of fun and a great learning experience. In addition to learning web development the course touches on mobile apps as well! The instructors (shout out to Dan V Ahmed and Pavan) know their stuff and really go the extra mile to help students succeed. You will learn a lot of real world programming skills finish with a solid portfolio to showcase to employers and meet some like-minded friends along the way. Also having a Demo Day where you can network with employers at the end of the program was a huge plus. But you need to be realistic with your goals and expectations. undefinedYou may notice a lot of reviews on this page are either love it or hate it so I think you should ask yourself 3 questions before you commit to this course:
Here is some insight into the three questions above:
 undefinedundefined    I actually graduated from Rutgers University with a 4 year degree and was in the workforce for two years before signing on to the bootcamp. I came from a Mechanical/Industrial Engineering background so I was no stranger to a difficult course load. I had a decent foundation in knowing how to code but I was missing a lot of the bigger picture parts of actually knowing how to create and deploy a website or app. The bootcamp filled all these gaps. undefined    The course felt very inclusive and it had an active Slack community were you could post questions chat with students and collaborate on projects. Having this community made it feel a lot more inclusive than my classroom experience in college. Outside of lecture there were also many (optional) video sessions you could attend (for no additional charge). These sessions included an Interview Weekly session where instructors and former bootcamp students talked about interviewing skills and how they liked working in tech. Other sessions also included Mini-Hackathons were instructors former students and people in the industry gave coding walkthroughs on making chat bots data analysis twitter bots etc. undefined    You could feel that the instructors and TAs really were passionate about coding and often took extra initiative to nail down concepts. I found my instructor Dan V to be very engaging during lecture and honestly he did a better job explaining concepts than most of my college professors. Some TAs were former bootcamp students but they are also very knowledgeable and helpful. Often top performing bootcamp graduates are asked to come on to the program as TAs.  undefined    The course is true to it’s “full stack” name. You learn how to make a fully functional website that looks good feels responsive and connects to a database. As an added perk the course briefly touches on mobile app development too. The pace is quick but sustainable just be sure to keep up with the weekly homework assignments. The homework assignments are critical in learning the material thoroughly and they also become part of your portfolio to showcase to employers. undefined    The bootcamp does not guarantee job placement. I repeat the bootcamp does not offer job placement. The course is very up front about this but you should understand how this impacts your job search. After graduation other bootcamps take a percentage of your first year’s salary as payment for the course. Rutgers Coding Bootcamp does not it is based on a flat rate up front payment. While this often makes it cheaper to attend the bootcamp has no incentive to do your job search for you.    Instead the bootcamp offers job assistance. These include resume writing sessions networking techniques (and events) interviewing skills and learning how to maintain a LinkedIn presence. Overall I would say it was pretty helpful. To get the most out of career services you will need to be proactive. I recommend attending the Interview Weekly sessions and keeping your portfolio page and Github up-to-date. And presenting at Demo Day is a must!    Personally I found the job search more difficult than actually learning the course load. I sent out about 70 applications and rarely heard back from employers. Definitely avoid the temptation of a “one click apply” approach. From my observations I would say that the best approach to landing a new job was by networking with current students bootcamp graduates and TAs/instructors. Ultimately I landed my current job by networking with a classmate. undefined    Would I take the course again? Yes. Not only did I land a new job but I now have a sweet new hobby. The $9500 was a lot of money but I learned a lot of material quickly met like-minded students and have a very valuable skillet. I am writing this review 2 months after graduation. I skill keep in touch with my instructor and classmates.
SCARLET KNIGHTS,2/27/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Somerset , LinkedIn,5,5,5,0,I have not yet graduated the course but I do feel confident enough to leave a review about this boot camp in the remaining time I have left.Prior to this boot camp I’ve had around 13 years of coding experience and was looking for something to fill any gaps I may have had. I spent months researching and even had chances at sponsorships at other schools. What turned me to Rutgers Coding Bootcamp was not only the name but also the reviews I’ve read about the instructors.Coming into the class I was a bit scared that maybe it would be difficult and perhaps fall behind but it turned out to be the complete opposite for me. With my prior experience in coding I found it extremely easy and was breezing through just about all the assignments that were given. Now I’m not saying I’m not learning anything new at all… I do pick up things here and there that I never knew before. Some of the stuff I picked up from class made my development life a bit easier.I cannot say this boot camp is taking me from zero to hero in terms of coding experience. For me it’s just filling in missing bits and pieces.For my class I had Pavan and personally I don’t think I’d choose anyone else. He is passionate about what he does shares his excitement with the class and just overall makes the entire course feel alive. I don’t think any other instructor at any other school could top him. He is the real deal and he puts so much effort into his students you cannot go wrong with Pavan.Now… if you were to ask me if I would join this class again I would say probably not. The reason being is because I have so much prior coding knowledge and $10000 is quite a bit of cash to only pick up bits here and there. If they offered an advanced course then I’d join it in a heartbeat. Do I regret joining this class? No. I’ve met some great people and hope the friendships and connections I got out of it last me a lifetime and to me that is worth the $10k.If you were to ask me who should join Rutgers Coding Bootcamp then I’d suggest anyone who considers joining has at least some background in code. If you happen to be someone who has no knowledge in programming then I’d HIGHLY suggest you learn from free online resources first. Doing so you’ll find out if you enjoy coding and you’ll have a head start if you do decide to join this boot camp.Who shouldn’t join this boot camp? Someone who only looks at the salary instead of the big picture. Coding is an “art” and people who have a passion for it are the ones who succeed the most in this field. The salary is nice but what is the point if you wake up every day hating what you do? So really ask yourself if this is what you want to do.Overall this boot camp is worth the money if you have some prior experience and are looking to turn to this career path. Just be prepared for a lot of work. This easily turns into a full-time gig for some students.After I graduate I will update this review with updated information regarding career services my job search experience etc.

SCARLET KNIGHTS,8/9/2017,,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,3,This course changed my life I found a career that I love and I have never been happier.The staff (instructors and TA's) were sooo patient and knowlegable. And really helped me learn the material. My only regret is working so much during the class. This course does take a lot of time. 
SCARLET KNIGHTS,8/9/2017,    Full Stack Flex - Full Time ,    Somerset ,,5,5,5,5,I attended Rutgers undergrad for computer science for a few semesters and became discouraged by the amount of time I had to spend on work for breadth requirement courses when I wanted to devote most of my time to computer science work.  I'd find myself in the library writing papers and doing homework for courses that I had no interest in but was forced to take.  Fast forward a few years and I saw the opportunity to take this Coding Bootcamp and jumped on it immediately.I took the 12 week (full-time) course rather than the 24 week (part-time) course and honestly I loved how condensed it was.  Going into it I thought I'd have trouble paying attention through a five hour class every day but I quickly found that most days class would end and I wished that it was longer.  If you take the 12 week course it's definitely very important to stay on top of the assignments but as long as you start the homework a reasonable amount of time before the due date it's no problem to get it finished and even find a little extra time to add your own flair to it.For a little context I had some experience in Java but it was so far in the past for me that I didn't utilize it much.  I worked three nights a week as well so it's possible to have a job at the same time but I wouldn't overload your schedule.  Especially towards the tail end of the course.  Many students had zero prior experience in coding prior to the bootcamp and while some struggled in the beginning to pick up core concepts they all finished the course as fantastic coders.  I would work with any single one of them in the future.  I just finished yesterday so I can't really speak on job placement but they have a career services department who will help you craft your resume teach you what questions you will encounter in interviews and set you up with recruiting agencies.  We even had a few recruiters attend the presentation for our final projects which was cool.Our instructor Franklin Dawes was amazing.  Super helpful always took the time to answer questions thoroughly.  He'd go over the same thing several times if necessary but somehow still managed to keep us on track with the curriculum every day.  Alan Chu and Tom Keel were our TA's and they were just as fantastic.  Really supportive people who attended the bootcamp in a prior session and came out very knowledgeable.  We had a few other guest TA's Aaron Mark Tammer Rob I'm sure I'm missing some.  They were all great too and someone in my class by the name of Adam Kwan will be a TA for the next full time course I believe.  He was an all star all semester in our class and pretty much acted as a third TA for a lot of us so I'm sure he'll be awesome.  Finally Juanita Soranno helped out with career services and acted as our cheerleader throughout the course.  She's super helpful knows her stuff when it comes to coding and is very accomodating if anything arises.Bottom line if you want to learn to be a web developer in 12 or 24 weeks you can't go wrong taking this course.  It's not easy so take it seriously but I think you'll find it less and less of a chore as you get farther into the course to keep up and more just something you want to do.
SCARLET KNIGHTS,7/15/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,After searching for two years on what should I learn next I stumbled into the Rutgers Bootcamp at first I was skeptical but after doing some research I decided to join. After the first couple of lessons I knew this was going to be challenging; see I came from a hardware background and had no idea what coding was. The program advisor told me to go and practice in code academy before the class starts and as a good slacker I totally forgot. So when the class started I was zero in programming but Ahmed (my instructor) was such an awesome teacher that I got to understand the concepts being taught to a high level This is not an easy course and it is not for everyone you need to have the drive to learn and push beyond your limits "IS LIKE STARTING TO LEARN A LANGUAGE FROM SCRATCH". I just want to thank all the staff for the time being put into this course and especially Ahmed for being Great.  "Another One"! I will always remember this course as a life changing experience!!!!. After graduating I can say I am a developer with the capacity to keep on learning new programming languages because I have not just learned how to code in this program "I have learned how to learn".
SCARLET KNIGHTS,6/29/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,4,5,5,1,
SCARLET KNIGHTS,6/7/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,I came into this course with no technical experience whatsoever. I had a desire to add to my skillset in a changing employment landscape. This course was one of the most difficult frustrating and humbling educational experience I've ever had. I had some incredible instructors and other students lept at the chance to help those who were struggling. I think a collaborative environment is pretty essential in a course like this and Rutgers Coding Bootcamp delivered on that one hundred percent. While the program advertises itself as one that will help you transition to a pure development I think it's easy to see that everyone -- folks with writing backgrounds like myself included -- should at the very least have a better understanding of the underlying technologies of the web. I would wholeheartedly reccomend the course. 
SCARLET KNIGHTS,4/17/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,4,5,5,4,This will be a short review but what I wanted to concentrate on is the faculty and staff. Going in as a blank slate in regards to Dev I was certainly worried about my ability to keep up with the curriculum and rest of class. But the Ahmed (my instructor) was easily the best teacher I've had in my life. With an ability to put difficult concepts into simpler terms and with the support of the TA's and classmates this was the most enjoyable learning experience I've ever had. Do yourself a favor and take the plunge as this may become the most important six-months in your life!
SCARLET KNIGHTS,2/21/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,The Rutgers Coding Bootcamp program is the best investment I have made for my future as a web developer.  This course is in depth and intellectually challenging.  The professor and the TAs knew how challening the course was and therefore went above and beyond to assist every student.  Ahmed Nate and Will were always available for help with homework and to encourage students who began to doubt themselves.  I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to pursue a career in web development.
SCARLET KNIGHTS,2/7/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,At Rutgers Coding Bootcamp the pace was fast and the work was intense. But thanks to Ahmed's light-hearted teaching style the classes felt fun even when I was really challenged. The instruction was clear and it was obvious that a lot of thought had been put into the curriculum design. At the end of the course you will not only know full-stack web development but you will have a good understanding of how to teach yourself any other programming language or technical skill. Really the process is made that clear. In addition to the regular classes students enrolled in the program have the opportunity to take a plethora of free workshops. Knowing how important it is to keep abreast of up and coming technologies they provided us with a chance to learn Elixir and Phoenix. Since I have a graphic design background I especially appreciated the free workshops on UI and D3.js that I was able to take. In fact alumni get to participate in a lot of the free workshops too. The entire team is very supportive of the alumnis continuing education. 
SCARLET KNIGHTS,2/4/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,4,5,4,I'm confident that given the time I could have learned everything I learned in the program on my own. However as I've heard emphasized several times now the best software engineers are not just masters of the technical aspects but they're excellent communicators and collaborators. Such soft skills are easy to miss if you don't have the environment that this class provides. If you want to make the most of it I strongly encourage that you connect with fellow students instructors TAs and speakers. Though it may not be immediately apparent the indirect effect of making that effort will pay off.Overall Ahmed was an excellent instructor the TAs were helpful the students were engaged and I'm happy with the results.
SCARLET KNIGHTS,1/23/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,4,My experience with the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp was phenomenal. I had tried to learn some web development basics on my own prior to the class but I was never as successful as with the bootcamp’s guided learning. They provided the structure that I needed to make sense of a field that can seem incredibly daunting and complex for someone coming from an entirely different world. They helped me learn how to learn so I could continue even after the class ends. With all that said there is nothing that will substitute hard work and hours of dedication. The immense dedication with which Ahmed our instructor went into each class was inspiring. He really went above and beyond to ensure that everyone received a well-rounded experience. Learning to code is like learning a new language. Put the work into it and you open a new world of possibilities. Nothing is handed to you but there’s always someone there to help you if you feel like you’re struggling. It’s an investment in yourself that you have to work hard at but you’re never alone. 
SCARLET KNIGHTS,1/23/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,I highly recommend RCB to anyone looking to get into web development. I have a background in business and prior to joining I had a little bit of knowledge about HTML and CSS from online courses. I felt like I was at a stand still because I wanted a formal and immersive learning experience. Grad school was too long considering the tech field is continuously changing and the bootcamps I found either required a background in tech/computer science or seemed like a waste of time and money. Not only did I learn a lot while attending RCB but this experience has been truly life changing. I'm leaving RCB with a very strong foundation and the knowledge I've gained is transferable to other languages and frameworks I'm interested in learning. Everything I've learned is directly relevant to what an entry level/junior developer requires.I attended the Jersey City location and Ahmed was my instructor. He's extremely knowledgeable committed and ALWAYS available. The class picks up quickly. The first two weeks we learned HTML and CSS and by the third week we moved onto JavaScript and then Jquery. The classes usually started out with a lecture and then we moved onto exercises (sometimes we worked individually or did pair programming). Like most things in life you get what you put in. If you are dedicated and proactive I'm sure you will be very satisfied with your experience at RCB.
SCARLET KNIGHTS,1/20/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,I absolutely loved the bootcamp. The curriculum was very intensive but I felt that it taught us the necessary languages and discipline to not only dip our feet into the Web Development world but succeed if the right amount of time and work was put into the class. It was NOT easy at any point in the course but I was lucky enough to have an AMAZING instructor (Ahmed) and two AMAZING tutor assistants (Nate and Will). There was an endless amount of support literally 24/7. I never felt like I was bothering anyone when I asked for help and never felt that I was so lost that I wouldn't be able to catch up (which was my biggest fear coming into this bootcamp). My instructor genuinely wanted to be there and help all of us succeed. Aside from the education aspect my instructor classmates and TA's have helped me grow as a professional and also as a person. I am forever grateful for my whole RCB team.
SCARLET KNIGHTS,12/21/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,4,4,4,4,I found RCB at a time in my life when things weren't adding up as they should. Do well on your SAT's get into college and you'll get a good job they said. But this "life formula" turned out not to work for me. I thought I was doing everything right but eventually found myself not being able to wake up happy every morning. I decided to finally bite the bullet and sign up for a coding bootcamp. I had nothing to lose.The main reason I chose this program over others was because of its proximity as well as the flexibility in the part-time program. I had to work full-time while attending the class so this was my biggest concern. The curriculum offerings were also standard with the industry. As well the bootcamp was offered through Rutgers University and I liked that I got a little bit of "college experience" out of it. Students ranged widely in ages profession and skill level but I found that it was a safe place to network with others without feeling judged. It helped me become comfortable to talk to other "coders" and maybe one day call myself that.The greatest advantage of a having face-to-face class was that if I needed hand-holding I could always find someone to talk to. But to really excel I had to be able to push past my own limitations. The lectures provided a foundation on which I could exercise my creativity when doing the homework. The most helpful sessioins were doing a timed coding test in class and doing mock interviews with live feedback. I think that whether one graduates still a novice or an employable professional largely depends on an array of personal factors but previous coding experience is not one of them. Learning is a lifelong skill and practice makes perfect; I felt that RCB did a good job of emphasizing that. When it came to applying for jobs the biggest threshold for me was getting an interview. Sending a resume was definitely not enough and Career Services was able to help me get in the door on more than a few occassions. Demo Day pushed me to get my portfolio ready and practice talking with employers. In fact I found that it wasn't difficult to demonstrate my skills and willingness to keep learning. When I started RCB in January I was despondent and unsure of what "path" in life I was taking. For the first few weeks I forced myself to get into the routine of squeezing in time for a quick dinner between work and class and trying to not fall behind. But it wasn't long before I found myself doing all-nighters because I wanted to and gaining a sense of accomplishment when I made that final push to GitHub for all the world to see. (And then pushing it again a few minutes later because of a bug.)And now entering into the last few weeks of the year I am starting a new job and I am a lot more optimistic with the direction I am going. Thank you to a great instructor and friend Ahmed to the best section TA's Peter and Faisal and also to Quincy for fielding all my in-class questions Patrick for the intro to Python and Peleke for taking an hour out of your time to talk about RxJS. Also to Stacey for always telling me where to park to Career Services especially Nalani and Zach who were great to work with and kept me motivated post-graduation and to my family and friends for their encouragement and support along the way. What a year it's been and I can't wait for the next!
SCARLET KNIGHTS,9/14/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,Taking this course was honestly the best decision I ever made.  I was in a career I was not happy with and I always wanted to learn to code so that's when I choose to apply to the bootcamp.  The instructor was fantastic the TAs are always there to help either in person or through the internet.  I learned so much through the course and now I have a full-time job as a developer and I am so much happier with my career.  The curriculum was very good and focused on teaching students technologies that the market needs developers for.  The job assistance was fantastic as well the student success coordinator I was assigned stayed in touch and set up phone calls to talk about my job search often and didn't stop until I had got an offer. 
SCARLET KNIGHTS,9/11/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,I recently graduated from the program in July 2016 and life has just not been the same since (pardon the cliche). I must admit that at about the 3 week mark I began asking myself if I could have gone the self teaching route that others have offered as an alternative. For me it would not have been a stretch since I have a background in IT (comp sci undergrad MIS grad). Web development was something I was interested in because so much of my prior experience had been on the systems side (process improvment project management quality assurance) and I was looking to transition my career track towards something that was more "hands on" if you will. Plus it's easier for developers to telecommute; systems people usually have to be at the office. Now that I've completed the program I know that I would not have nearly the amount of knowledge had I tried to self teach the skills I learned at the RCB. I am the parent of a soon-to-be 3 year old and a soon-to-be 1 year old at home so "self" anything is just about non-existent. I was lucky enough to be able to get to class 3 days a week for 6 months during which time I learned not only all the languages frameworks and other technologies that enable me to build complete web apps from scratch but also some intangible lessons in collaboration team building and problem resolution. Most importantly I got to work with knowledgeable personable people students and staff many of which I hope to keep in contact with years to come. As far as the curriculum I felt that the course moved along in a natural progression and at a very rapid pace which I liked - it wouldn't be much of a 'bootcamp' if it didn't. Of course there were times when I felt overwhelmed and there is a lot of pressure to not fall behind in the material. I was always able to get help from TAs/Instructors when I needed it and the career services support is stellar. I personally was able to earn myself a nice raise at my present job along with some other incentives and accolades with the skills I learned at the RCB. If you are looking for a career change or even just a skills retooling for Web development I would highly recommend the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. The format curriculum and support staff are all top-notch indicative of the Rutgers namesake. You must remember however that you MUST be willing and able to put in the work outside of attending classes. As with so many other things in life what you get out of this program will depend enormously on what you are willing to put into it. 
SCARLET KNIGHTS,9/9/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,4,5,5,First off I just want to start by saying that this was the best academic experience of my life. I have struggled with staying excited and motivated in the traditional university experience for years. Ahmed my instructor was the best teacher I have ever had. The TA's Peter Faisal Dan and many others were some of the best mentors I have ever had. Career Services has brought me so many different exciting opportunities I would have never been able to find on my own. And my fellow students were some of the nicest most helpful people I have ever met. Okay with that being said here is my breakdown of the 6 month adventure that was Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. I was in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp and graduated about a month and a half ago. It was a great experience. I felt like I have a group of people that I will be friends with for the rest of my life. That includes the studentsteachers TA's and career services people. On top of the great social experience I had a great experience academically as well. I am definitely at the level of a junior level web developer. When going into this I did a lot of research on coding bootcamps and a few pieces of advice I listened to helped me a lot. Many people that had negative reviews on bootcamps said that the pace was too much (not from RCB but from other bootcamps). I am in no means the fastest learner. Going into a 6 month part-time program and coming out a competent full-stack developer was definitely a daunting task. What I did that helped with the pace of the program was actually did all the prework plus I went over the curriculum and did some of my own additional work (html css light js). So going into the program it was if I took a prerequisite for the bootcamp. So in the program I definitely struggled but with the help of my fellow students as well as TA's and awesome instructor Ahmed. I can't describe how amazing they were. So before the program was over I had one freelance job and than since the program was over I have done contract work with one company have had numerous clients contacting me for freelance work and have went on two interviews. Remember that this has only been a month and a half out of the program. Nalani and the rest of career services have been working their a**es of to get us jobs and it really shows. Ultimately it has been said time and time again. These people are giving you great resources and amazing staff  and providing you with a great platform and experience... What you do with it is what will determine your success during and after the program. 
SCARLET KNIGHTS,9/8/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,4,I graduate from this bootcamp next month (October 2016) and am proud to say that I've learned a ton over the last ~5 months. The TAs and instructors really care and do what they can to help us succeed our Slack community is very active and they are always on there answering people's questions when we are not physically in class. All the classes are recorded and you can go back and watch them any time. And the vast majority of the people in the class have kept up with material so one can derive that the pace is ideal even for those with full-time jobs (of which there are many). The biggest testament to this fact are the recent round of group projects which we presented for the class and were We have classes 3x a week with the students being split between Monday/Wednesday and Tuesday/Thursday classes and everyone meeting on Saturday. I'm in the Tuesday/Thursday group and our instructor Matt Kim is The instructors are very helpful and stay late after each class to help those who need it and are very responsive online as I've said but we are expected to do our best to reinforce new concepts and research things we don't understand. This is how coding works: StackOverflow and Google are huge parts of the job. Your future employer can't (yet) install new knowledge directly into your brain via some microchip or spend hours explaining every nuance of a new concept. You will be expected to know how to learn and self-reliance in this area is crucial.We started off learning front-end design including HTML CSS Bootstrap Javascript jQuery etc. and moved on roughly half way through the course to back-end development focusing on Node.js. Now we are going back to the front-end learning React. I feel as though I have a solid balanced understanding of web development and feel I've built up the necessary base of skills to teach myself any new programming concepts or languages that I need to know in the future. These days I have a strong sense of optimism about my future being excited to take what I've learned and apply it to create something awesome.__All that being said there are a few categories of people who might fall behind to the point where they need to drop out:1) People who 2) People who are 3) People who know nothing about computers or coding. The course doesn't assume much foreknowledge but it would be very wise to study HTML CSS and Javascript to some degree before coming in even if that means just taking the corresponding Codecademy classes. This will give you a good head start and prevent you from getting overwhelmed freaking out and starting to believe that you're not smart enough to learn to code.__I started learning HTML CSS and Ruby on Rails a few months before the course so the first few weeks weren't too challenging for me. I worried that the class would be too easy but the pace quickly picked up and the work became quite challenging and continues to be so. That said challenge is how we learn and I am grateful to be learning so much in a relatively short amount of time.I have yet to begin the career services part of the Bootcamp which begins after we technically 'graduate' and is something we have to apply for and meet certain requirements. I gave "job assistance" 4 stars because I would have liked the job assistance requirements to be less intimidating--but they are still manageable. Based on my experience with the class I expect that the career services will be very helpful for landing a job after the course ends. We have had career services talks on various Saturday classes which have provided us with great resume and LinkedIn advice.__Overall I would definitely recommend Rutgers Coding Bootcamp and am happy to have found such a great bootcamp in New Jersey. I'm wholeheartedly grateful for my experience here.
SCARLET KNIGHTS,9/6/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,I recently graduated from the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp and I couldn't feel more proud of myself.Going into this I knew the program would be intense and a lot of responsibility would fall on me to keep up with the workload. I was able to complete this program while attending work full time and dealing with the many ups and downs that life likes to throw at us.The first two months of the program were met with feelings of hope excitement frustration and an overall feeling of being lost.While the instructors do their best and will go above and beyond to help it is up to us as students to help them guide us. I realized this a few weeks in. Learning to code is nothing like sitting in class for four years to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree.In order to make the most out of the class reach out to the instructor go to office hours and practice a little every day. If you do this you will be off to a great start. Also reach out to your peers and learn with them; they are probably just as nervous as you. The work can be intimidating but let go of the fear and be open to having your mind challenged in the best of ways.Halfway through the program is when I started feeling a little more comfortable and looking back at everything that I had learned and accomplished. Take pride in even the smallest steps because they will push you even further. At times I still felt lost on some concepts but all I needed to do was put in more time to learn on my own and ask the instructor for a one on one.Towards the end of the class almost everyone was still nervous and worried about being prepared for a job in this field. This feeling is okay after talking to people in the field even they still feel lost sometimes. Coding is about accepting the fact that you will never know everything but being open to learning anything. Follow what your interest are and stay passionate. Even if you don't find a job right away keep at it and stay positive.All of the instructors for this program have been amazing. I have worked mostly with Ahmed and he has been an inspiration to me. He was always positive and helped lift my spirits when I was ready to walk away. Don't be afraid to reach out to the instructors if you are having a hard time and need support they are understanding and want you to succeed.As for the career services portion of the class they put together a lot of networking events to attend; however I personally couldn't make some of them due to work constraints. Even with this they do offer many networking experiences to take advantage of as well as assistance with your resume and portfolio.Something to keep in mind is that this program is constantly developing and growing stronger with every month that passes and every class that graduates. While the program isn't a smooth easy ride into the hands of a successful job offer I would definitely recommend it to everyone interested in coding. This program challenges you as a person as a coder and as a student. There are many lessons to be had. Take advantage of all the resources they provide to you and make the most out of it. You get what you put in much like the garbage in garbage out expression.Another huge positive for me was the flexibility of the course and being able to work full time while furthering my education. I’d also like to add a personal note from my experience as a woman in this field/program to other woman. There is a great amount of support for us in this field if you know where to look. Reach out to the instructors and career services as they will guide you to helpful resources. Don’t be intimidated if you walk into a class with only a handful of woman. Once everyone gets to know each other and the walls come down amazing things happen. Everyone was great and willing to help. Even if you do happen to come across a not so pleasant person just remember maybe they are having a hard time themselves.For anyone interested in this class don’t let your mind trick you into thinking you are less than and that you can’t do it. I know I struggled with that and looking back now I am very proud of myself for the applications that I have built and the knowledge that I take with me. As well as the friends and long term support that I have come away with. Don’t give up - follow your dreams.Update: I was able to find a lucrative job shortly after the program while the job doesn't focus on coding alone it is in the IT field and there will be times that I can use my coding skills. The decision to take this job over a strictly web based development job was a personal one as it combined another passion of mine. I am very grateful for the coding bootcamp as this showed the interviewer that I was dedicated hardworking and willing to put in effort. The excellent recommendation from the instructor helped greatly!I’ll leave you with a cheesy yet feel good quote - I know they have helped me keep going when I least expected it."If your dreams do not scare you they are not big enough" - Ellen Johnson Sirleaf
SCARLET KNIGHTS,8/28/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,I can definitely reccomend the bootcamp to anyone who is roughly in my position -- I had a little prior experience doing programming and a little bit of familiarity with the unix command line but that was it.  I had never worked in IT and hadn't touched a programming language or tried to hand code HTML since high school.  The only javascript I knew was learned from a couple days of working through tutorials on Codeacademy before classes began.  My point is that I had to rely on the two lead instructors (and the TAs) to learn Javascript Jquery SQL React MongoDB and Node/Express from scratch.  They did a very good job of guiding students such as myself through some very demanding arcane sometimes frustrating technical subject matter.  They did a great job of patiently working through students' questions on everything from CSS positioning to callback functions to general questions about web development as a career.  And yes it definitely showed that they were professional web developers rather than say CS researchers.Anyway they got the job done which for me was to learn how to sit down at an IDE and be able to write a basic 'MEARN' stack web app from scratch.  Also I found the cirriculum was pretty well-designed.  It follows a pretty sensible trajectory from HTML CSS and JS/Jquery through nodejs server programming/routing/etc then databases and then finally JS frameworks interrupted by three 2-4 week group projects.  It's all javascript/node js so you get a good opportunity to learn a very popular language intensively.  I really could not imagine putting together a similar learning experience for myself through self-study or taking an assortment of online courses.So again I definitely reccomend this program if you've made the decision that you 1. enjoy programming but aren't an expert and 2. want to work as a web developer.  Don't do it (or any bootcamp) if you can't answer yes confidently to 1 and 2.  To address one last thing -- the job assistance so far has been pretty good.  I've gotten plenty of helpful feedback on cover letters and have found that they take a very active role in checking in on the job search process.  Much much better than what I experienced in my four years as an undergraduate long ago.
