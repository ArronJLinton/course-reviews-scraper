RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/9/2017,    Full Stack Flex - Full Time ,    Somerset , GitHub,5,4,5,4,"I'll admit when I signed up at the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp I was real nervous. I was scared that I wouldn't have a great support system and I would just barely survive the bootcamp. However all those fears disappeared the second I walked into the classroom. There I was surrounded by great students and faculty who wanted nothing more than to create coders who were going to \'crush it!\' The curriculum is intense to say the very least but you're learning the basic foundations that you can continue to build off of. There was no stone left unturned with the amount of information that we absorbed.I loved coming to class every day and be surrounded by these incredibly ambitious and goal driven students. We really were a little family together. I know for a fact that all of us are going to remain in touch and be the biggest cheerleaders when it comes to finding a job.The only thing I wish I did prior to becoming a student was code a little bit more. You can totally join the boot camp having zero coding background but sitting down and taking basic courses on Udemy was really helpful to me. I just wish I had done more!  I absolutely recommend the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp to anyone who wants to change their lives and start a new career. "
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,6/13/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City , LinkedIn,4,5,5,2,"Before you read this write-up will be a bit too long this could be a mix of review overview and what to expect. If you're like me were admitted to the program had concerns and kept hunting for reviews a month before the class started I hope this will quell fears. It's understandable if you do its a lot of money and a huge investment but I'd do it again in a heartbeat. A lot of bootcamps expect you to quit your job to attend but RCB is held three days a week with hours that don't interfere with typical work hours which will be a plus for many.I attended the program in their Jersey City satellite location. My commute was about two and a half hours on a good day with public transportation from the Bronx but being right next to the PATH was extremely convenient.A little background on myself in case if there is someone who is reading is currently in the situation that I was in before I enrolled. I studied media studies but not too soon after graduating I realized the job market wasn't what I was expecting it to be for the field.I had a pretty good handle on HTML and CSS before starting the class as I had taken a few classes on them. When it came to JavaScript and everything else I had no idea about the technology that it took to make a website. Before I really took to dive I went through numerous tutorials and books to explore programming to see if it was for me. If you are highly considering programming as a career path and have no prior experience with code I suggest the following resources (in order of quality IMO):FreeCodeCampAdmissionsRutgers Coding Bootcamp wasn't the only program I tried to get into. I've applied to a lot and not every one of them has the same admissions process. Typically the higher-priced (or salary-based) ones have several rounds of coding tests and interviews. A lot of them were extremely daunting as they replicated the actual process of the application process for the typical programmer's position some of them even expected applicants to know recursion which baffled me. But applying to Rutgers was really pleasant compared to the other processes I went through. Some of them were so impersonal and demoralizing that I step away from coding for a few months.Rutgers started with a general info session with a Trilogy rep who gives you a run down of the program. Based on that conversation if you are ready the process starts and you'll have an interview with admissions. They'll take your background interest in the program and your experience with programming. From there you'll take an online multiple-choice assessment and then based on your score you'll have another interview session that's only slightly technical with a tricky logic question. It's worth noting that for every stage of the admissions process you'll be on the phone with someone which I did like since it added a human touch to it.After that it's only a few days before you get the final verdict. In all for me the process only took two weeks from speaking with an information rep to getting the decision and it was pretty painless.The Teaching StaffMy class was led by Peleke and Matt with Boris and Theory being the Teaching Assistants. These four are amazingly patient human beings who want nothing more than for you and your classmates to succeed. They will not only make learning code enjoyable and interesting they will teach you how to break down concepts remind you about the fundamentals and inspire you to push your brain to the limit. Don't hesitate to ask questions if you do they'll always have an answer. They are all very humble and empathetic and understand if you are having trouble picking up a concept they'll work tirelessly with you to make sure you are comfortable with it. They will go above and beyond to make sure that your projects are ready for deployment and bug-free even if it's into the wee hours of the night.With all of the terminologies and syntax it's hard to get a high-level understanding of things but with the program you'll have plenty of practice. Each class you'll have 10 or more activities that'll make use of each tech.But even if you are not assigned the same teaching staff I've had fear not as Trilogy is pretty good as sourcing their staff as they're all extremely knowledgeable and will pretty much have an answer to any question you throw at them.Your cohort is assigned a student success manager who is pretty much makes sure you're on track with your homework up to snub with the material provides info on the course and helps you get in touch with the various Trilogy Services. I haven't had to ask Kalimah for too many things but she was always great at helping me out and informing the class of changes and anything we need to do.The CourseThe program itself is excellent. The curriculum is finely tuned and top notch. For those who are concerned with only learning the newest and \'hottest\' tech and afraid that what you'll learn will be outdated have no fear. The curriculum team is constantly working on the course material and are always adjusting to what technology is in-demand at the moment like React JS. If somehow Vue JS becomes the next de-facto JavaScript framework I'm sure the team will adjust the curriculum to that. At the end of my cohort we were scheduled to spend a week (for each) on Java and Python but React JS had picked up so much steam we skipped those two and spent extra time on React.24 weeks sounds like a very long time but I didn't feel like it. Regardless of any program DO NOT expect that you will learn the in's and out's of any programming language. That is simply not enough time to master anything but it is enough time to get pretty good at something.The first 2 - 3 weeks you'll go through git and Github with a crash course in HTML and CSS. After that you'll get into JavaScript and jQuery. But right after that is where things pick-up with Node JS and the course starts getting interesting. By the end of the course you'll be comfortable with databases and frameworks like React JS.There is a homework assignment that's due two weeks from when it was assigned. Each homework assignment deals with the tech that is learned and you're given the option of doing assignments into difficulties one of them being the easier to do. In total there are three group projects which will expect you to make use of all the technology you have learned as well as incorporating anything not covered in class. These were extremely fun yet incredibly frustrating all for good reasons. They not only add to your portfolio but help you get a sense of how to work in a team version control and learn project management.Besides class time and work there are plenty of opportunities to learn provided by Trilogy throughout the 24 weeks. They do \'hackathons\' on a weekly basis typically on a Friday night where someone will teach a programming language not a part of the curriculum or go over something like React JS more in depth. These are done online with other cohorts alumni and teachers from other Trilogy programs around the country. They are really informative and voluntary so if you do have extra time outside of class work I definitely recommend doing them. They are recorded so if you miss them they are viewable once the videos are encoded and uploaded to Youtube.I haven't had to use them but Trilogy does provide tutoring services so if you do find yourself struggling with class work you can as for a 1-on-1 session and they are at no extra cost.Career ServicesDo not expect any sort of job placement from Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. From the very first day they will iterate that they do not have any sort of job placement program in place. They had workshops on how to build your online presence practice sessions for job interviews and webinars with industry folks. I had the impression that they were still ironing things out in their career service which is a real shame since the curriculum is quite excellent.While I didn't expect to be handed a job after graduation career services left a lot to be desired. There were tons of communication breakdowns or lack of. At times there were career service webinars scheduled during work hours which a lot of people couldn't attend. They did tell us for demo day/graduation that there was going to be a few hiring managers there to connect with but none showed up. Career service was kind of a mess but they were in the middle of a revamp I guess. It would be nice if they organized meetup-like events. There are opportunities outside of class to network in the area but it could be tough getting to recruiters and hiring managers at those.The TakeawaysTL;DR 
	Overall based on the strength of the curriculum and the material you'll learn I can wholeheartedly recommend this program. Learning programming is very hard and it's easy to get into the notion that it's a breeze with bootcamps promising you to be a master programming in three months. The reality is you won't come out of any bootcamp as a master developer and you won't after completing this one. There is simply not enough time to learn everything. So with that programming is hard and the folks at Trilogy know this. Although career service wasn't the most robust aspect it shouldn't deter you from considering this program you'll learn a lot and have fun doing it. *****If you feel that this is the program for you or you've already been admitted and preparing to start here are some things I suggest on doing:PRACTICE and REPEAT:GOOGLE is your best friend:Throw your ego into the Hudson River: Help your classmates out:Go all in on projects and homework assignments:"
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,6/8/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City , LinkedIn,5,5,5,3,"I am so thankful that I found Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. I needed a program near where I lived from a trusted and reputable source that allowed me to continue working. The structure of this program is ideal for those who cannot give the 60-80 hours/week required by many full-time bootcamps. Not only that the slower pace over a 24 week program aids retention of concepts and affords time to apply new concepts creatively. I continued learning concepts that a bootcamp does not have the time to cover and explored tech outside the curriculum. Since this bootcamp is connected with a larger organization Trilogy Education Services with bootcamps and several major universities across the US the coding community is strong and the opportunites to learn from one another are great. Pavan Katepalli is the CLO for the organization. He holds weekly training sessions and miniHackathons where I met students from other bootcamps and learned new concepts and technology outside the normal curriculum. Trilogy also provides free tutoring services for students who need assistance. I was able to begin tutoring other students while in the program and continue tutoring to this day."
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,4/2/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Somerset , GitHub,5,4,5,3,"undefined    This program was a lot of fun and a great learning experience. In addition to learning web development the course touches on mobile apps as well! The instructors (shout out to Dan V Ahmed and Pavan) know their stuff and really go the extra mile to help students succeed. You will learn a lot of real world programming skills finish with a solid portfolio to showcase to employers and meet some like-minded friends along the way. Also having a Demo Day where you can network with employers at the end of the program was a huge plus. But you need to be realistic with your goals and expectations. undefinedYou may notice a lot of reviews on this page are either love it or hate it so I think you should ask yourself 3 questions before you commit to this course:
	Here is some insight into the three questions above:
	 undefinedundefined    I actually graduated from Rutgers University with a 4 year degree and was in the workforce for two years before signing on to the bootcamp. I came from a Mechanical/Industrial Engineering background so I was no stranger to a difficult course load. I had a decent foundation in knowing how to code but I was missing a lot of the bigger picture parts of actually knowing how to create and deploy a website or app. The bootcamp filled all these gaps. undefined    The course felt very inclusive and it had an active Slack community were you could post questions chat with students and collaborate on projects. Having this community made it feel a lot more inclusive than my classroom experience in college. Outside of lecture there were also many (optional) video sessions you could attend (for no additional charge). These sessions included an Interview Weekly session where instructors and former bootcamp students talked about interviewing skills and how they liked working in tech. Other sessions also included Mini-Hackathons were instructors former students and people in the industry gave coding walkthroughs on making chat bots data analysis twitter bots etc. undefined    You could feel that the instructors and TAs really were passionate about coding and often took extra initiative to nail down concepts. I found my instructor Dan V to be very engaging during lecture and honestly he did a better job explaining concepts than most of my college professors. Some TAs were former bootcamp students but they are also very knowledgeable and helpful. Often top performing bootcamp graduates are asked to come on to the program as TAs.  undefined    The course is true to it’s “full stack” name. You learn how to make a fully functional website that looks good feels responsive and connects to a database. As an added perk the course briefly touches on mobile app development too. The pace is quick but sustainable just be sure to keep up with the weekly homework assignments. The homework assignments are critical in learning the material thoroughly and they also become part of your portfolio to showcase to employers. undefined    The bootcamp does not guarantee job placement. I repeat the bootcamp does not offer job placement. The course is very up front about this but you should understand how this impacts your job search. After graduation other bootcamps take a percentage of your first year’s salary as payment for the course. Rutgers Coding Bootcamp does not it is based on a flat rate up front payment. While this often makes it cheaper to attend the bootcamp has no incentive to do your job search for you.    Instead the bootcamp offers job assistance. These include resume writing sessions networking techniques (and events) interviewing skills and learning how to maintain a LinkedIn presence. Overall I would say it was pretty helpful. To get the most out of career services you will need to be proactive. I recommend attending the Interview Weekly sessions and keeping your portfolio page and Github up-to-date. And presenting at Demo Day is a must!    Personally I found the job search more difficult than actually learning the course load. I sent out about 70 applications and rarely heard back from employers. Definitely avoid the temptation of a “one click apply” approach. From my observations I would say that the best approach to landing a new job was by networking with current students bootcamp graduates and TAs/instructors. Ultimately I landed my current job by networking with a classmate. undefined    Would I take the course again? Yes. Not only did I land a new job but I now have a sweet new hobby. The $9500 was a lot of money but I learned a lot of material quickly met like-minded students and have a very valuable skillet. I am writing this review 2 months after graduation. I skill keep in touch with my instructor and classmates."
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,2/27/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Somerset , LinkedIn,5,5,5,0,"I have not yet graduated the course but I do feel confident enough to leave a review about this boot camp in the remaining time I have left.Prior to this boot camp I’ve had around 13 years of coding experience and was looking for something to fill any gaps I may have had. I spent months researching and even had chances at sponsorships at other schools. What turned me to Rutgers Coding Bootcamp was not only the name but also the reviews I’ve read about the instructors.Coming into the class I was a bit scared that maybe it would be difficult and perhaps fall behind but it turned out to be the complete opposite for me. With my prior experience in coding I found it extremely easy and was breezing through just about all the assignments that were given. Now I’m not saying I’m not learning anything new at all… I do pick up things here and there that I never knew before. Some of the stuff I picked up from class made my development life a bit easier.I cannot say this boot camp is taking me from zero to hero in terms of coding experience. For me it’s just filling in missing bits and pieces.For my class I had Pavan and personally I don’t think I’d choose anyone else. He is passionate about what he does shares his excitement with the class and just overall makes the entire course feel alive. I don’t think any other instructor at any other school could top him. He is the real deal and he puts so much effort into his students you cannot go wrong with Pavan.Now… if you were to ask me if I would join this class again I would say probably not. The reason being is because I have so much prior coding knowledge and $10000 is quite a bit of cash to only pick up bits here and there. If they offered an advanced course then I’d join it in a heartbeat. Do I regret joining this class? No. I’ve met some great people and hope the friendships and connections I got out of it last me a lifetime and to me that is worth the $10k.If you were to ask me who should join Rutgers Coding Bootcamp then I’d suggest anyone who considers joining has at least some background in code. If you happen to be someone who has no knowledge in programming then I’d HIGHLY suggest you learn from free online resources first. Doing so you’ll find out if you enjoy coding and you’ll have a head start if you do decide to join this boot camp.Who shouldn’t join this boot camp? Someone who only looks at the salary instead of the big picture. Coding is an “art” and people who have a passion for it are the ones who succeed the most in this field. The salary is nice but what is the point if you wake up every day hating what you do? So really ask yourself if this is what you want to do.Overall this boot camp is worth the money if you have some prior experience and are looking to turn to this career path. Just be prepared for a lot of work. This easily turns into a full-time gig for some students.After I graduate I will update this review with updated information regarding career services my job search experience etc."

RUTGERS,TRILOGY,9/1/2017,,,,5,5,5,4,"The curriculum staff. and network of peers I have built up from the program helped me enact some profound changes in my life. The program helped me find the skills not only develop full stack web applications right now but also confidence and knowledge to dive into new software and languages."
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/9/2017,,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,3,"This course changed my life I found a career that I love and I have never been happier.The staff (instructors and TA's) were sooo patient and knowlegable. And really helped me learn the material. My only regret is working so much during the class. This course does take a lot of time. "
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/9/2017,    Full Stack Flex - Full Time ,    Somerset ,,5,5,5,5,"I attended Rutgers undergrad for computer science for a few semesters and became discouraged by the amount of time I had to spend on work for breadth requirement courses when I wanted to devote most of my time to computer science work.  I'd find myself in the library writing papers and doing homework for courses that I had no interest in but was forced to take.  Fast forward a few years and I saw the opportunity to take this Coding Bootcamp and jumped on it immediately.I took the 12 week (full-time) course rather than the 24 week (part-time) course and honestly I loved how condensed it was.  Going into it I thought I'd have trouble paying attention through a five hour class every day but I quickly found that most days class would end and I wished that it was longer.  If you take the 12 week course it's definitely very important to stay on top of the assignments but as long as you start the homework a reasonable amount of time before the due date it's no problem to get it finished and even find a little extra time to add your own flair to it.For a little context I had some experience in Java but it was so far in the past for me that I didn't utilize it much.  I worked three nights a week as well so it's possible to have a job at the same time but I wouldn't overload your schedule.  Especially towards the tail end of the course.  Many students had zero prior experience in coding prior to the bootcamp and while some struggled in the beginning to pick up core concepts they all finished the course as fantastic coders.  I would work with any single one of them in the future.  I just finished yesterday so I can't really speak on job placement but they have a career services department who will help you craft your resume teach you what questions you will encounter in interviews and set you up with recruiting agencies.  We even had a few recruiters attend the presentation for our final projects which was cool.Our instructor Franklin Dawes was amazing.  Super helpful always took the time to answer questions thoroughly.  He'd go over the same thing several times if necessary but somehow still managed to keep us on track with the curriculum every day.  Alan Chu and Tom Keel were our TA's and they were just as fantastic.  Really supportive people who attended the bootcamp in a prior session and came out very knowledgeable.  We had a few other guest TA's Aaron Mark Tammer Rob I'm sure I'm missing some.  They were all great too and someone in my class by the name of Adam Kwan will be a TA for the next full time course I believe.  He was an all star all semester in our class and pretty much acted as a third TA for a lot of us so I'm sure he'll be awesome.  Finally Juanita Soranno helped out with career services and acted as our cheerleader throughout the course.  She's super helpful knows her stuff when it comes to coding and is very accomodating if anything arises.Bottom line if you want to learn to be a web developer in 12 or 24 weeks you can't go wrong taking this course.  It's not easy so take it seriously but I think you'll find it less and less of a chore as you get farther into the course to keep up and more just something you want to do."
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,7/15/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,"After searching for two years on what should I learn next I stumbled into the Rutgers Bootcamp at first I was skeptical but after doing some research I decided to join. After the first couple of lessons I knew this was going to be challenging; see I came from a hardware background and had no idea what coding was. The program advisor told me to go and practice in code academy before the class starts and as a good slacker I totally forgot. So when the class started I was zero in programming but Ahmed (my instructor) was such an awesome teacher that I got to understand the concepts being taught to a high level This is not an easy course and it is not for everyone you need to have the drive to learn and push beyond your limits \'IS LIKE STARTING TO LEARN A LANGUAGE FROM SCRATCH\'. I just want to thank all the staff for the time being put into this course and especially Ahmed for being Great.  \'Another One\'! I will always remember this course as a life changing experience!!!!. After graduating I can say I am a developer with the capacity to keep on learning new programming languages because I have not just learned how to code in this program \'I have learned how to learn\'."
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,6/29/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,4,5,5,1,""
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,6/7/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,"I came into this course with no technical experience whatsoever. I had a desire to add to my skillset in a changing employment landscape. This course was one of the most difficult frustrating and humbling educational experience I've ever had. I had some incredible instructors and other students lept at the chance to help those who were struggling. I think a collaborative environment is pretty essential in a course like this and Rutgers Coding Bootcamp delivered on that one hundred percent. While the program advertises itself as one that will help you transition to a pure development I think it's easy to see that everyone -- folks with writing backgrounds like myself included -- should at the very least have a better understanding of the underlying technologies of the web. I would wholeheartedly reccomend the course. "
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,4/17/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,4,5,5,4,"This will be a short review but what I wanted to concentrate on is the faculty and staff. Going in as a blank slate in regards to Dev I was certainly worried about my ability to keep up with the curriculum and rest of class. But the Ahmed (my instructor) was easily the best teacher I've had in my life. With an ability to put difficult concepts into simpler terms and with the support of the TA's and classmates this was the most enjoyable learning experience I've ever had. Do yourself a favor and take the plunge as this may become the most important six-months in your life!"
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,2/21/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,"The Rutgers Coding Bootcamp program is the best investment I have made for my future as a web developer.  This course is in depth and intellectually challenging.  The professor and the TAs knew how challening the course was and therefore went above and beyond to assist every student.  Ahmed Nate and Will were always available for help with homework and to encourage students who began to doubt themselves.  I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to pursue a career in web development."
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,2/7/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,"At Rutgers Coding Bootcamp the pace was fast and the work was intense. But thanks to Ahmed's light-hearted teaching style the classes felt fun even when I was really challenged. The instruction was clear and it was obvious that a lot of thought had been put into the curriculum design. At the end of the course you will not only know full-stack web development but you will have a good understanding of how to teach yourself any other programming language or technical skill. Really the process is made that clear. In addition to the regular classes students enrolled in the program have the opportunity to take a plethora of free workshops. Knowing how important it is to keep abreast of up and coming technologies they provided us with a chance to learn Elixir and Phoenix. Since I have a graphic design background I especially appreciated the free workshops on UI and D3.js that I was able to take. In fact alumni get to participate in a lot of the free workshops too. The entire team is very supportive of the alumnis continuing education. "
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,2/4/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,4,5,4,"I'm confident that given the time I could have learned everything I learned in the program on my own. However as I've heard emphasized several times now the best software engineers are not just masters of the technical aspects but they're excellent communicators and collaborators. Such soft skills are easy to miss if you don't have the environment that this class provides. If you want to make the most of it I strongly encourage that you connect with fellow students instructors TAs and speakers. Though it may not be immediately apparent the indirect effect of making that effort will pay off.Overall Ahmed was an excellent instructor the TAs were helpful the students were engaged and I'm happy with the results."
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,1/23/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,4,"My experience with the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp was phenomenal. I had tried to learn some web development basics on my own prior to the class but I was never as successful as with the bootcamp’s guided learning. They provided the structure that I needed to make sense of a field that can seem incredibly daunting and complex for someone coming from an entirely different world. They helped me learn how to learn so I could continue even after the class ends. With all that said there is nothing that will substitute hard work and hours of dedication. The immense dedication with which Ahmed our instructor went into each class was inspiring. He really went above and beyond to ensure that everyone received a well-rounded experience. Learning to code is like learning a new language. Put the work into it and you open a new world of possibilities. Nothing is handed to you but there’s always someone there to help you if you feel like you’re struggling. It’s an investment in yourself that you have to work hard at but you’re never alone. "
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,1/23/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,"I highly recommend RCB to anyone looking to get into web development. I have a background in business and prior to joining I had a little bit of knowledge about HTML and CSS from online courses. I felt like I was at a stand still because I wanted a formal and immersive learning experience. Grad school was too long considering the tech field is continuously changing and the bootcamps I found either required a background in tech/computer science or seemed like a waste of time and money. Not only did I learn a lot while attending RCB but this experience has been truly life changing. I'm leaving RCB with a very strong foundation and the knowledge I've gained is transferable to other languages and frameworks I'm interested in learning. Everything I've learned is directly relevant to what an entry level/junior developer requires.I attended the Jersey City location and Ahmed was my instructor. He's extremely knowledgeable committed and ALWAYS available. The class picks up quickly. The first two weeks we learned HTML and CSS and by the third week we moved onto JavaScript and then Jquery. The classes usually started out with a lecture and then we moved onto exercises (sometimes we worked individually or did pair programming). Like most things in life you get what you put in. If you are dedicated and proactive I'm sure you will be very satisfied with your experience at RCB."
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,1/20/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,"I absolutely loved the bootcamp. The curriculum was very intensive but I felt that it taught us the necessary languages and discipline to not only dip our feet into the Web Development world but succeed if the right amount of time and work was put into the class. It was NOT easy at any point in the course but I was lucky enough to have an AMAZING instructor (Ahmed) and two AMAZING tutor assistants (Nate and Will). There was an endless amount of support literally 24/7. I never felt like I was bothering anyone when I asked for help and never felt that I was so lost that I wouldn't be able to catch up (which was my biggest fear coming into this bootcamp). My instructor genuinely wanted to be there and help all of us succeed. Aside from the education aspect my instructor classmates and TA's have helped me grow as a professional and also as a person. I am forever grateful for my whole RCB team."
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,12/21/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,4,4,4,4,"I found RCB at a time in my life when things weren't adding up as they should. Do well on your SAT's get into college and you'll get a good job they said. But this \'life formula\' turned out not to work for me. I thought I was doing everything right but eventually found myself not being able to wake up happy every morning. I decided to finally bite the bullet and sign up for a coding bootcamp. I had nothing to lose.The main reason I chose this program over others was because of its proximity as well as the flexibility in the part-time program. I had to work full-time while attending the class so this was my biggest concern. The curriculum offerings were also standard with the industry. As well the bootcamp was offered through Rutgers University and I liked that I got a little bit of \'college experience\' out of it. Students ranged widely in ages profession and skill level but I found that it was a safe place to network with others without feeling judged. It helped me become comfortable to talk to other \'coders\' and maybe one day call myself that.The greatest advantage of a having face-to-face class was that if I needed hand-holding I could always find someone to talk to. But to really excel I had to be able to push past my own limitations. The lectures provided a foundation on which I could exercise my creativity when doing the homework. The most helpful sessioins were doing a timed coding test in class and doing mock interviews with live feedback. I think that whether one graduates still a novice or an employable professional largely depends on an array of personal factors but previous coding experience is not one of them. Learning is a lifelong skill and practice makes perfect; I felt that RCB did a good job of emphasizing that. When it came to applying for jobs the biggest threshold for me was getting an interview. Sending a resume was definitely not enough and Career Services was able to help me get in the door on more than a few occassions. Demo Day pushed me to get my portfolio ready and practice talking with employers. In fact I found that it wasn't difficult to demonstrate my skills and willingness to keep learning. When I started RCB in January I was despondent and unsure of what \'path\' in life I was taking. For the first few weeks I forced myself to get into the routine of squeezing in time for a quick dinner between work and class and trying to not fall behind. But it wasn't long before I found myself doing all-nighters because I wanted to and gaining a sense of accomplishment when I made that final push to GitHub for all the world to see. (And then pushing it again a few minutes later because of a bug.)And now entering into the last few weeks of the year I am starting a new job and I am a lot more optimistic with the direction I am going. Thank you to a great instructor and friend Ahmed to the best section TA's Peter and Faisal and also to Quincy for fielding all my in-class questions Patrick for the intro to Python and Peleke for taking an hour out of your time to talk about RxJS. Also to Stacey for always telling me where to park to Career Services especially Nalani and Zach who were great to work with and kept me motivated post-graduation and to my family and friends for their encouragement and support along the way. What a year it's been and I can't wait for the next!"
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,9/14/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,"Taking this course was honestly the best decision I ever made.  I was in a career I was not happy with and I always wanted to learn to code so that's when I choose to apply to the bootcamp.  The instructor was fantastic the TAs are always there to help either in person or through the internet.  I learned so much through the course and now I have a full-time job as a developer and I am so much happier with my career.  The curriculum was very good and focused on teaching students technologies that the market needs developers for.  The job assistance was fantastic as well the student success coordinator I was assigned stayed in touch and set up phone calls to talk about my job search often and didn't stop until I had got an offer. "
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,9/11/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,"I recently graduated from the program in July 2016 and life has just not been the same since (pardon the cliche). I must admit that at about the 3 week mark I began asking myself if I could have gone the self teaching route that others have offered as an alternative. For me it would not have been a stretch since I have a background in IT (comp sci undergrad MIS grad). Web development was something I was interested in because so much of my prior experience had been on the systems side (process improvment project management quality assurance) and I was looking to transition my career track towards something that was more \'hands on\' if you will. Plus it's easier for developers to telecommute; systems people usually have to be at the office. Now that I've completed the program I know that I would not have nearly the amount of knowledge had I tried to self teach the skills I learned at the RCB. I am the parent of a soon-to-be 3 year old and a soon-to-be 1 year old at home so \'self\' anything is just about non-existent. I was lucky enough to be able to get to class 3 days a week for 6 months during which time I learned not only all the languages frameworks and other technologies that enable me to build complete web apps from scratch but also some intangible lessons in collaboration team building and problem resolution. Most importantly I got to work with knowledgeable personable people students and staff many of which I hope to keep in contact with years to come. As far as the curriculum I felt that the course moved along in a natural progression and at a very rapid pace which I liked - it wouldn't be much of a 'bootcamp' if it didn't. Of course there were times when I felt overwhelmed and there is a lot of pressure to not fall behind in the material. I was always able to get help from TAs/Instructors when I needed it and the career services support is stellar. I personally was able to earn myself a nice raise at my present job along with some other incentives and accolades with the skills I learned at the RCB. If you are looking for a career change or even just a skills retooling for Web development I would highly recommend the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. The format curriculum and support staff are all top-notch indicative of the Rutgers namesake. You must remember however that you MUST be willing and able to put in the work outside of attending classes. As with so many other things in life what you get out of this program will depend enormously on what you are willing to put into it. "
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,9/9/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,4,5,5,"First off I just want to start by saying that this was the best academic experience of my life. I have struggled with staying excited and motivated in the traditional university experience for years. Ahmed my instructor was the best teacher I have ever had. The TA's Peter Faisal Dan and many others were some of the best mentors I have ever had. Career Services has brought me so many different exciting opportunities I would have never been able to find on my own. And my fellow students were some of the nicest most helpful people I have ever met. Okay with that being said here is my breakdown of the 6 month adventure that was Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. I was in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp and graduated about a month and a half ago. It was a great experience. I felt like I have a group of people that I will be friends with for the rest of my life. That includes the studentsteachers TA's and career services people. On top of the great social experience I had a great experience academically as well. I am definitely at the level of a junior level web developer. When going into this I did a lot of research on coding bootcamps and a few pieces of advice I listened to helped me a lot. Many people that had negative reviews on bootcamps said that the pace was too much (not from RCB but from other bootcamps). I am in no means the fastest learner. Going into a 6 month part-time program and coming out a competent full-stack developer was definitely a daunting task. What I did that helped with the pace of the program was actually did all the prework plus I went over the curriculum and did some of my own additional work (html css light js). So going into the program it was if I took a prerequisite for the bootcamp. So in the program I definitely struggled but with the help of my fellow students as well as TA's and awesome instructor Ahmed. I can't describe how amazing they were. So before the program was over I had one freelance job and than since the program was over I have done contract work with one company have had numerous clients contacting me for freelance work and have went on two interviews. Remember that this has only been a month and a half out of the program. Nalani and the rest of career services have been working their a**es of to get us jobs and it really shows. Ultimately it has been said time and time again. These people are giving you great resources and amazing staff  and providing you with a great platform and experience... What you do with it is what will determine your success during and after the program. "
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,9/8/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,4,"I graduate from this bootcamp next month (October 2016) and am proud to say that I've learned a ton over the last ~5 months. The TAs and instructors really care and do what they can to help us succeed our Slack community is very active and they are always on there answering people's questions when we are not physically in class. All the classes are recorded and you can go back and watch them any time. And the vast majority of the people in the class have kept up with material so one can derive that the pace is ideal even for those with full-time jobs (of which there are many). The biggest testament to this fact are the recent round of group projects which we presented for the class and were We have classes 3x a week with the students being split between Monday/Wednesday and Tuesday/Thursday classes and everyone meeting on Saturday. I'm in the Tuesday/Thursday group and our instructor Matt Kim is The instructors are very helpful and stay late after each class to help those who need it and are very responsive online as I've said but we are expected to do our best to reinforce new concepts and research things we don't understand. This is how coding works: StackOverflow and Google are huge parts of the job. Your future employer can't (yet) install new knowledge directly into your brain via some microchip or spend hours explaining every nuance of a new concept. You will be expected to know how to learn and self-reliance in this area is crucial.We started off learning front-end design including HTML CSS Bootstrap Javascript jQuery etc. and moved on roughly half way through the course to back-end development focusing on Node.js. Now we are going back to the front-end learning React. I feel as though I have a solid balanced understanding of web development and feel I've built up the necessary base of skills to teach myself any new programming concepts or languages that I need to know in the future. These days I have a strong sense of optimism about my future being excited to take what I've learned and apply it to create something awesome.__All that being said there are a few categories of people who might fall behind to the point where they need to drop out:1) People who 2) People who are 3) People who know nothing about computers or coding. The course doesn't assume much foreknowledge but it would be very wise to study HTML CSS and Javascript to some degree before coming in even if that means just taking the corresponding Codecademy classes. This will give you a good head start and prevent you from getting overwhelmed freaking out and starting to believe that you're not smart enough to learn to code.__I started learning HTML CSS and Ruby on Rails a few months before the course so the first few weeks weren't too challenging for me. I worried that the class would be too easy but the pace quickly picked up and the work became quite challenging and continues to be so. That said challenge is how we learn and I am grateful to be learning so much in a relatively short amount of time.I have yet to begin the career services part of the Bootcamp which begins after we technically 'graduate' and is something we have to apply for and meet certain requirements. I gave \'job assistance\' 4 stars because I would have liked the job assistance requirements to be less intimidating--but they are still manageable. Based on my experience with the class I expect that the career services will be very helpful for landing a job after the course ends. We have had career services talks on various Saturday classes which have provided us with great resume and LinkedIn advice.__Overall I would definitely recommend Rutgers Coding Bootcamp and am happy to have found such a great bootcamp in New Jersey. I'm wholeheartedly grateful for my experience here."
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,9/6/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,"I recently graduated from the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp and I couldn't feel more proud of myself.Going into this I knew the program would be intense and a lot of responsibility would fall on me to keep up with the workload. I was able to complete this program while attending work full time and dealing with the many ups and downs that life likes to throw at us.The first two months of the program were met with feelings of hope excitement frustration and an overall feeling of being lost.While the instructors do their best and will go above and beyond to help it is up to us as students to help them guide us. I realized this a few weeks in. Learning to code is nothing like sitting in class for four years to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree.In order to make the most out of the class reach out to the instructor go to office hours and practice a little every day. If you do this you will be off to a great start. Also reach out to your peers and learn with them; they are probably just as nervous as you. The work can be intimidating but let go of the fear and be open to having your mind challenged in the best of ways.Halfway through the program is when I started feeling a little more comfortable and looking back at everything that I had learned and accomplished. Take pride in even the smallest steps because they will push you even further. At times I still felt lost on some concepts but all I needed to do was put in more time to learn on my own and ask the instructor for a one on one.Towards the end of the class almost everyone was still nervous and worried about being prepared for a job in this field. This feeling is okay after talking to people in the field even they still feel lost sometimes. Coding is about accepting the fact that you will never know everything but being open to learning anything. Follow what your interest are and stay passionate. Even if you don't find a job right away keep at it and stay positive.All of the instructors for this program have been amazing. I have worked mostly with Ahmed and he has been an inspiration to me. He was always positive and helped lift my spirits when I was ready to walk away. Don't be afraid to reach out to the instructors if you are having a hard time and need support they are understanding and want you to succeed.As for the career services portion of the class they put together a lot of networking events to attend; however I personally couldn't make some of them due to work constraints. Even with this they do offer many networking experiences to take advantage of as well as assistance with your resume and portfolio.Something to keep in mind is that this program is constantly developing and growing stronger with every month that passes and every class that graduates. While the program isn't a smooth easy ride into the hands of a successful job offer I would definitely recommend it to everyone interested in coding. This program challenges you as a person as a coder and as a student. There are many lessons to be had. Take advantage of all the resources they provide to you and make the most out of it. You get what you put in much like the garbage in garbage out expression.Another huge positive for me was the flexibility of the course and being able to work full time while furthering my education. I’d also like to add a personal note from my experience as a woman in this field/program to other woman. There is a great amount of support for us in this field if you know where to look. Reach out to the instructors and career services as they will guide you to helpful resources. Don’t be intimidated if you walk into a class with only a handful of woman. Once everyone gets to know each other and the walls come down amazing things happen. Everyone was great and willing to help. Even if you do happen to come across a not so pleasant person just remember maybe they are having a hard time themselves.For anyone interested in this class don’t let your mind trick you into thinking you are less than and that you can’t do it. I know I struggled with that and looking back now I am very proud of myself for the applications that I have built and the knowledge that I take with me. As well as the friends and long term support that I have come away with. Don’t give up - follow your dreams.Update: I was able to find a lucrative job shortly after the program while the job doesn't focus on coding alone it is in the IT field and there will be times that I can use my coding skills. The decision to take this job over a strictly web based development job was a personal one as it combined another passion of mine. I am very grateful for the coding bootcamp as this showed the interviewer that I was dedicated hardworking and willing to put in effort. The excellent recommendation from the instructor helped greatly!I’ll leave you with a cheesy yet feel good quote - I know they have helped me keep going when I least expected it.\'If your dreams do not scare you they are not big enough\' - Ellen Johnson Sirleaf"
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/28/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,"I can definitely reccomend the bootcamp to anyone who is roughly in my position -- I had a little prior experience doing programming and a little bit of familiarity with the unix command line but that was it.  I had never worked in IT and hadn't touched a programming language or tried to hand code HTML since high school.  The only javascript I knew was learned from a couple days of working through tutorials on Codeacademy before classes began.  My point is that I had to rely on the two lead instructors (and the TAs) to learn Javascript Jquery SQL React MongoDB and Node/Express from scratch.  They did a very good job of guiding students such as myself through some very demanding arcane sometimes frustrating technical subject matter.  They did a great job of patiently working through students' questions on everything from CSS positioning to callback functions to general questions about web development as a career.  And yes it definitely showed that they were professional web developers rather than say CS researchers.Anyway they got the job done which for me was to learn how to sit down at an IDE and be able to write a basic 'MEARN' stack web app from scratch.  Also I found the cirriculum was pretty well-designed.  It follows a pretty sensible trajectory from HTML CSS and JS/Jquery through nodejs server programming/routing/etc then databases and then finally JS frameworks interrupted by three 2-4 week group projects.  It's all javascript/node js so you get a good opportunity to learn a very popular language intensively.  I really could not imagine putting together a similar learning experience for myself through self-study or taking an assortment of online courses.So again I definitely reccomend this program if you've made the decision that you 1. enjoy programming but aren't an expert and 2. want to work as a web developer.  Don't do it (or any bootcamp) if you can't answer yes confidently to 1 and 2.  To address one last thing -- the job assistance so far has been pretty good.  I've gotten plenty of helpful feedback on cover letters and have found that they take a very active role in checking in on the job search process.  Much much better than what I experienced in my four years as an undergraduate long ago.                    "
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/25/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,"Return on Investment. Keep that term etched on your memory when you sign up for any bootcamp when you enroll in a university when you join a gym etc. You will get exactly what you put into this. Just as your personal trainer can't lift for you and give you an eight pack the staff can't MAKE you learn the material- that will be up to you.Time for the review: There are no books but then again this is a web dev course. Market reasearch was conducted (and is constantly being conducted for future cohorts) in order to put the curriculum together so there's that. The instructors and the TAs are excellent - they really want to see everyone succeed. I've never experienced a more accessible and encouraging staff both inside and outside of the classroom. The most awesome part is that for the TAs and the instructors it doesn't seem like it's over post graduation. There's hackathons that are planned and they're still available and eager to help. As far as the career help goes I'm still riding out out my current contract to completion so I momentarily opted out.Now back to my annoying \'ROI\' statement above. You get exactly what you put into this course. For some people the course went too slow for others it went too fast- but it's really up to you to make it just right. There are a lot of comp sci grads that take this course as well as people who studied things and have worked in fields that had absolutely nothing to do IT - I'm one of the latter. That means that I had to put in double or even triple the effort than some of my peers (this was exceedingly difficult to accomplish with a FT job) but it's what I signed up for.To me the course went extremely fast in terms of the 6 month life span. Again it's not due to a problem with the curriculumn but more of the fact that I still feel uneasy with my code as yet again this has been a complete change for me. However the learning doesn't start and stop in relation to class- you really have to put in the work. The instructors and the TAs truly care and make themselves available but it's up to you to make those 10k count.Also I'd like to give a quick shout out to my peers- they are truly a great bunch. I made lots of new friendships was exposed to many ideas and differing ways of approaching programming through the minds of other budding developers."
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/24/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,"Met some of the greatest people while learning significant knowledge of the latest technologies in building web and mobile applications at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. Every class was an enjoyment. The instructors are extremely knowledgable and are there for you the entire way. Post-class I've accomplished my career change into the tech field. These guys give you the tools to succeed!"
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/24/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,"I'm a recent RCB graduate and I had a wonderful experience. The instructors are always there to help and guide you and the TAs stay late to answer your questions. You will learn a lot. Their curriculum is solid but it's up to you to show up to class ready to work. All of the class lectures are recorded and available for students to view at anytime (even after you graduate!)  along with the corresponding lesson plan. Each week there is a new homework assignment. Take these seriously as they will account for your portfolio. The job assistance is great too. The career department motivates you to connect with employers leading up to graduation and well after you've graduated. Overall I am satisfied with RCB and I would recommend the program! "
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/23/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,"I wanted to change my profession and thats why I joined RCB and that was the best decision ever. I had zero experience in computer programming before  I joined RCB but after six months of intense course I feel very confident and proud of myself. My instructor Ahmed Haque was very enthusiastic and always available to help students. The TAs are very very good. There were so many times they had sacrificed there personal time just to help me. At one point I needed some extra help and they actually schedule two extra virtual classes for me . The timings and location of the classes are such that one can continue their job and study at the same time. They cover so many things in short time so the pace is little fast but bright side of it is we get to learn so many things. They provide lot of information and help. Practice will make you successful. I would totally recommend this course."

RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/22/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,"Prior to Rutgers Coding Bootcamp I had been working at an Apple Retail Store for 4 years. During my time there I became interested in software development but they didn't really have much in the way of assistance in transitioning from Retail to Corporate doing anything other than retail related things.A lot of what you learn at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp is HOW TO LEARN. So there's a lot of reading documentation asking for help on stackoverflow googling. This is literally half of what a software developer does at work in the real world. So finding answers to unfamiliar problems is a skill in and of itself. You do get plenty of help and support from instructors and TA's but thing's aren't just spoon fed to you because the idea is to train you to be able to work a developer job after or even before the program ends."
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/22/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,4,4,3,"I had graduated with a masters in biotechnology two years prior and knew I didn't want to continue with it.  I played around with the idea of coding for a while and finally decided to pull the trigger when I learned about RCB. Truthfully the coding bootcamp concept didn't sit too well with me at first but as I got to talking to the people who run the program in the interviews I felt that it was a good investment.I was part of the very first cohort- the instructors and TAs were dedicated every step of the way to making sure that we think like engineers and problem solvers. They were available for questions outside class time and were always excited to help us understand and diagnose the things that were blocking progress.Since I was working while I was doing the bootcamp I wasn't rushing to find a job and didn't really rely on the job support aspect of the bootcamp.  I applied around to a few different companies after graduation and kept in contact with the awesome career advisor to talk through my thoughts in navigating the murky waters of interviewing.  She always listened carefully and gave me good advice.About two months after graduating from the program I left my job at a global pharma company to work as a developer.  I'm really happy that RCB helped me make that change in my life.If you are looking to add a new dimension to your career or change up your career and are also hungry to learn then this program is definitely for you."
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/21/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,4,5,5,4,"I enrolled in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp's Full-Stack Flex program with very little experience in programming. Having gone through the program I can't begin to recommend this bootcamp enough. I feel as though I've been given all of the tools necessary to not only get begin my career as a developer but to become extremely successful as I continue on in the field of software development. The instructors for my section of the class were incredibly knowledgeable and were always willing to go the extra mile when I was feeling lost. I always knew that if I got stuck I could ask any instructor at any point in the day and they would go above and beyond to make sure that the core concepts were clear and that I felt comfortable applying these concepts to the projects I was working on. At certain points some of the instructors were even willing to drop what they were doing to start a Google hangout so that we could share screens and walk through code line by line together. The biggest reason for recommending Rutgers Coding Bootcamp is because they worked extremely hard to make sure we had the confidence necessary to go into our first round of challenging technical interviews. They were quick to point out strengths in your work and provide constructive feedback for areas of opportunity. Despite the many points of frustration that come with learning to code the instructors were always there to keep you on track. All in all my experience at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp gave me the skills and confidence needed to start a career in software development and I strongly encourage anyone looking to break into the field to apply for this program.  "
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/20/2016,,    Jersey City ,,1,1,1,1,"From beginning to the end it's broken promises. They fly through the material and don't get through the lesson plans and tell you if you have any questions to google it. The instructors don't help you at all . During the admission process they make it seem like it is a very selective process but no one is turned away. Any one who can pay the tuition will be accepted . The  people in the class are mostly high school drop outs looking for a fast way to make money. So there is no way a person will be successful in theat type of environment.I found the same course online which is totally free and you can learn at your own pace . Homework is not graded feedback is not given and when they do help they do the work for you which defeats the purpose of learning . Save your time and money don't make the same mistake I made.  During the entry process they make coding some easy and it's not. They don't offer books and everything they teach is not even used in today's market. I graduated received my certificate and every job offer I received was 14-16   Dollars an hour as a entry level developer. Spend the extra money and go to a real schoolThe student success manager is very manipulative she will sweet talk you all the way through and let you continue drowning . Once the course is over they will tell you that you do not qualify for job assistance since all the course requirements were not met.  The rules are made up as the course is made. The name is Rutgers but is actually a 3 Rd party who runs the course. They offered me to teach the course after I graduated which goes to show how desperate they are for help. I have a masters in mathematics so I know I am not dumb. My instructor that was teaching the course was a front end developer which is a entry level developer.The instructors and tas come in 5 minutes before class starts when they are suppose to come in 45 minutes earlier before class starts to help students but they don't . The deadline to drop the course is 2 weeks. The first 2 weeks are the best after 2 weeks when you are locked in to the contract that is when they really show you the course is going to be. I have shared my experience read all the reviews before making a commitment. The positive reviews look like inside reviews.  "
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/19/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,4,"Going to RCB was honestly one of the best decisions of my life.  It isn't an easy program it's challenging and exhausting but in a really really good way.  The way this program is taught forces you to not only learn the class curriculum but also spend a significant amount of time out of class learning on your own.  This program made me feel confident enough in my skills to quit my job and have a complete career change.  It was a terrifying risk to take but it was the best decision I've ever made and I wouldn't have done it without this program.  Looking back to where I was 6 months ago I am absolutely amazed at the things I can do.  The instructors and TAs were excellent. They actually cared about the success of each student in the class which is extremely important when you are doing such a challenging program.  I highly recommend this program to anyone who has the drive and enthusiasm necessary to become a web developer."
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/19/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,4,"Full-Disclosure: The boot camp hired me toward the end of the course as a part-time curriculum consultant.I enrolled in this course to learn the process of creating web apps with Node.js. There's a lot of technology involved when building out a full-stack project: markdown files JavaScript logic API routing database management version control and so on. I tried relying on online resources to study this info but the vast amount of content available made it arduous to chart out a clear learning path on my own. This led me to seeking out a nearby coding boot camp Rutgers being the closest (30 minute drive to New Brunswick vs 90 minute train to NYC).The course focused on the various components of a modern web app and moved through this material in a cohesive direction (database management before the Express framework essential full-stack tech before trending libraries like React and Angular etc.). My instructor Ahmed Haque taught each lecture with a friendly and energetic tone—his speaking style brought down to earth the abstractions and complexities inherent to web development. The instructor and TAs always provided exceptional assistance whether I needed a quick clarification or a more in-depth rundown—they always made sure I understood the material before helping the next student. Ahmed even created video tutorials for us to view on our own time for some of the tougher concepts.While 24 weeks makes for a lengthy course the wide breadth of client- and server-side technologies covered in this span gave the boot camp a brisk pace. Still by paying attention to the lectures studying outside the classroom and taking advantage of the one-to-one support I came out able to build full-stack apps with different frameworks and databases. Would recommend to anyone looking to do the same. "
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/18/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,4,4,5,1,"I'm going to make this review as detailed as possible I feel as though there aren't many testimonials for RCB out there and thanks to some SEO magic this pops up first. First of all long story short I was in the January 2016 cohort of the New Brunswick class and by the fifth month of the program I was fielding a number of job offers by a number of companies ranging from small startups to big corporations. I came into the program with zero coding experience and took this course along with my college coursework (I was in the final semester of my senior year at Rutgers). No my degrees were not in computer science. Yes my offers were more favorable than a number of my friends who graduated with a degree in CS. Every single line of code I typed was taught to me by my instructors: John and Ahmed. John was my main instructor while Ahmed instructed both sections of the January cohort on Saturdays. It cannot be overstated how incredible these two were at teaching us the beast that is Javascript. John was extremely patient with all of the students and kept us all engaged into the wee hours of the night on Tuesdays and Thursdays. He even stayed after class was finished on most nights to further aid students that needed extra help. John's teaching abilities surpassed that of the tenured professors that I studied under at Rutgers University. He also has a sense of humor that helped keep things light when Node or MySQL were beating us into the ground. I would not be at my job in my apartment or in my social standing right now if it were not for John. This sounds like a cinderella story which is why you're probably wondering about the one-star in the Job Assistance category. I would give it zero stars if I could. The reason why I decided to pay $9000 for this program was to not only learn how to be a software developer but to also enmesh myself into the network of connections that was advertised to me when I inquired about the program. At my initial inquiry I was told that we would eventually be working with companies on projects to see what it would be like to be a real-life developer. Didn't happen. During the first few weeks we were actually shown PowerPoints listing various companies who were connected as hiring partners to the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. It pains me to say that these hiring partners were non-existent when it came time to look for jobs. During the entirety of the program career services would take literal WEEKS to answer my messages about any topic at all. No matter how small or big the issue. By the fourth month I felt as though I was ready to begin applying for jobs. Due to the negligence of career services I sought advice from Ahmed about how to approach employers how to negotiate a fair salary and other important things about the technological job market in which I was not familiar. Thanks to Ahmed's advice - I was able to prepare myself for technical interviews salary negotiations as well as just giving me a a confidence boost when I initially started at my new job and started feeling overwhelmed. Ahmed John and Quincy (John's teaching assistant) were the sole proprietors from this entire experience of getting me from noob to full-time salaried software developer. It is because of them that I personally felt that this program was worth it.It truly is a shame that the incredible work done by these men are overshadowed by the incompetencies and utter disorganization of the career services. I was under the impression (and given the impression) that we would be connected with a wide array of companies to hopefully be placed with at the conclusion of the program. \'Career services\' has consisted of students being told to apply for ten jobs a week and a Google sheet with seemingly Google'd job postings for software developers. A big number of the postings actually ask for candidates who are seeking a mid-level developer with years of experience or a developer who has experience with frameworks that we were not taught at all in the program. Absolutely NOTHING like the connections they boasted about at the beginning of the program.In conclusion I am grateful for this program. Only for the fact that I have learned so much and have enjoyed every bit of learning during this experience. It has provided me with a skillset that will aid me for the rest of my life. At the end of the day my gripes are very specific and if I could go back I would absolutely choose the same path that I chose in the beginning of January. But hypothetically I would hope that I would possess the knowledge I have today about who in the program actually cares about each student's learning / overall success in life and who simply does not care and will feed you anything on a silver platter to get your check in the mail. "
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/16/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    Somerset ,,5,5,5,5,"I was once like you: a boringly normal human with a lame mostly administrative job and a random array of self-taught tech skills from HTML & CSS to the most rudimentary Ruby and Java. After enrolling in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp all of that changed. I moved up in my job I can charge a significantly higher $$$/hour rate for freelance work and I haven't even finished the program yet!After just a few months with RCB's instructors I could write fluent JavaScript model databases and I no longer have to search HTML and CSS attributes every five minutes while working on front-end projects. My career now has direction and for the first time in a long time it feels like my life has direction. In addition to its great instructors RCB also provides you with amazing career-focused guest speakers and an awesome career coach who will connect you with prospective jobs while equipping you with the skills to create stand-out tech resumés.If you want a better future register today!"
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/16/2016,,    Somerset ,,5,5,5,5,"I'd like to write a review about the April 2016 cohorts. I feel that this has been an amazing experience. The environment teachers and TA's are all very understanding and it feels like how college should have been. I have a Masters in Statistics but I wished I had more challenging programming courses in the tools used. After some experience as a Statistical analyst I thought I should go back to a program and learn applied programming (Rather than just theory) in a deeper level. I feel like I can apply my skills to a much broader field now. It is a pretty tough program but the environment makes a difference. It's a bootcamp so expect to be doing a lot of hard work. I am happy that it's not a traditonal lecture. I was always good at it but I never had enough hands on experience. I think compared to other schools 6 months is perfect yet just challenging enough.. Recently a couple of people have started getting jobs as well within 4 months!"
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/5/2016,,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,"(For reference I was in the January 2016 cohort at New Brunswick). I have to say that I am so blessed that I applied was accepted and had the experience that I did.  I will admit prior to starting the course I was scared.  Not only scared but anxious that I would fall behind nervous that I didn't have the \'brain\' for this kind of work and regretfully filled with \'what ifs\' about my personal success in the course.  But guess what? I did fall behind - and I got through it.  I must say that though these past six months were incredibly challenging and through the tears (yes there were tears!) I came out more successful than I ever had expected after just six months.  Rutgers Coding Bootcamp was an amazing experience.  It's super difficult to learn new material especially material that you have never once seen or touched before (my background is in Clinical Counseling) and so you have all these anxieties that you won't succeed. But trust me you will. At RCB you have the MOST help and support not only by the teacher (I had Ahmed and I will say he is a fantastic teacher! I don't doubt that John the other teacher was great but I can only speak for Ahmed) but also by the TA's. I have never felt more sense of security and generosity than I did in this course. With also the help by the career team you can be sure you will be helped every step of the way. If you are stuck on a homework assignment or just need help or even if you're having a break down and need a pep talk you will have access to your teacher and TA's every single day (trust me I know from experience) and I can promise you you will come out the other side more successful confident and capable than you ever thought beforehand. If I could re-do these past six months I would do so in a heartbeat. Go RCB! "
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/2/2016,,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,"I was working at a dead-end job with a pointless degree. My life was starting to spiral out of control and I didn't know what to do. Then I happened to stumble upon Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. The name Rutgers alone caught my eye since I graduated from Rutgers in 2013. The admission process was smooth and everyone was quick to respond during the intro stages.I came in with very little coding experience but from beginning to end the instructors and staff were there for me every step of the way. The program itself is intense meeting multiple times per week and dedicating time to homework all while working a full time job (definitely doable). The instructor (Ahmed) and TAs (Peter and Faisal) were extremely knowledgeable and helpful in every possible way. They take their time and make sure you do not fall behind and they definitely go that extra mile for their students.The curriculum is fine-tuned well thought out and will have you job ready in 6 months’ time. From attending classes to spending countless hours on homework and projects (all while making friends in the process =P ) I’m happy to say that my RCB experience was an amazing and successful one. I was able to land a position at a very reputable company right before graduation. Thank you to everyone at RCB for everything! "
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,7/26/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    Somerset ,,5,5,5,5,"First of all. I would like to thank all of the instructors and teaching staff's hard work. It has been an amazing experience with Rutgers Booting Camp so far. I really like the instructor's teaching style. The whole program is very well designed. Not only on the teaching part but also mange to show us how fun and powful code can be in our real life. My major is not computer science. I started on my own in the begining and found it is really something I am passionate about. Going back to school is the best choice I ever made. Becasue it is the only way for me to become more professional. Surounded by all the people who also share the same interests keeps me moving forward. Special thanks to Pavan my advisor and my instrutor Matt. It is really appreciated! RespectfullyChen "
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,7/25/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,"After graduating college and working in some full-/part-time opportunities I reached a point where I wasn't sure what to do with my life. When I most needed it an advertisement for Rutgers Coding Bootcamp appeared on my Facebook feed one day. I applied and waited for a response not realizing that I had made one of the best decisions of my life. As a bootcamp this program is intensive. You meet 3 times a week for 3-4 hours each class and will need to invest at least 20 hours a week to develop a firm understanding of a variety of technical concepts frameworks and languages. If you put in the time you will only boost your potential for success. The academic support in this program is second-to-none. The instructors (especially Ahmed Faisal and Peter) and staff all work tirelessly to help you reach your goals. The insight and the skills you develop from this program are invaluable not only to the Technology industry but also to life."
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,7/19/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,"I am two weeks away from graduating from the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp and can honestly say that it has been a life changing experience. I entered the program nervous and doubtful of my ability to become a full stack software developer. Now six months later I am exiting the program with a valuable set of skills and confident that I will be successful in the tech industry. I highly recommend this program. The support of the administration the dedication and compassion of the professors are unlike anything I have ever experienced before. "
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,7/9/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,"As a Rutgers alumni  I can say that the quality of education at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp exceeds the standards of education that I received as an undergrad.  Between the high quality instructors with a wealth of experience in the industry the extra support provided outside of class throughout the week and a curriculum that adapts to the constantly changing field of software development  RCB is a program that I am proud to have been a part of. Beyond learning about software engineering principles RCB teaches valuable skills such as how to prepare a resume specifically tailored to jobs in the IT industry how to market yourself on social media as well as how to ace the coding interview.   The career advisors helped me seamlessly transition from a career in a completely different industry to one as a full time programmer.  In addition the partnerships that the program has developed with IT companies in the Tri-State area exceeeded my expectations.  It was refreshing to see the quality of employers at our demo day - I actually received an interview directly from this event and started my career as a software engineer two weeks later!Reflecting back it's hard to believe that only six months ago I didn't even know basic HTML & CSS.  With RCB's help I was able to to learn the skills that I needed to become a full-stack developer and transition to a new career that I enjoy working in each day.  "
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,6/26/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,"I will be completing the RCB in about 4 weeks. The program is excellent and the staff has an enormous energy and ability to teach dense and detailed subject matter. Anyone considering the RCB must realize that it will take real dedication and a lot of hours but the payoff will be worth it. This curriculum can turn you into a full-stack developer in a mere 6 months. Try doing that on your own!Besides a dedicated staff and a well-organized curriculum the career services component and staff is second-to-none. They go the extra mile to make sure you are setting yourself up for success in the job market.All in all the experience has been very hard work with many many hours of learning on my own going to many classes and doing tons of coding for homework and group projects. But at the end there is tremendous satisfaction that the RCB delivered on what was promised."
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,11/16/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,4,5,3,5,"I attended the somerset campus and I'm writing this review a month after class has ended.CourseFirst off I reccommend attending FreeCodeCamp.com during the duration of this course to get the most out of it. This 6 month course will quickly go through the fundementals of programming to the moderately complex web development frameworks development environments package management version control quality control database management and many other important programming tools. Since the tech industry is a very fast paced world a 4 year degree in computer science could mean nothing by the time you get out you may have a steady foundation but with older programming languages or using outdated technology. Many languages don't last long and will phase out within a year or even less. This type of program avoids this problem by teaching you cutting edge languages in a short amount of time while also brushing over the fundementals. However there is a catch. If you don't put in a Classrom ExperienceThis course was treated as if it was a college classroom with a similar grading system and strict attendance rules. You will not end up working for IBM by just taking this course with the minimum effort. That goes for college or anything you do in life as well though so this should be obvious.To be honest this is meant to be either:
	Personal ExperienceI worked full time during the course with an intention of transitioning careers from IT to web development so my workload was full but I was still able to put in the extra time after class. I didn't have a great classroom experience at this course though. I have a medical condition that makes it difficult for me to socialize. Normally this isn't a problem but I felt very ostracized here. The TAs and teacher were standoffish and rude with an exception of some good days scattered throughout. The instructor also didn't come off as well educated most of the time and fumbled through a lot of the course material. Google was my true teacher. However I did hear good things about other instructors so maybe I just didn't get lucky here.Job AssistanceThe career advisors are still sending me opportunites and were very helpful before during and after the course. They can be slow with responding during the course but that should be expected since theres like 3 of them and so many students. ConclusionMost people won't have the same struggle I had with the students instructor and TAs so I'll end with this: If you know the basics of computer programming plus willing to put in the time and effort outside of class then you will benefit from this course while possibly landing yourself a decent job and the $10K cost is a good deal for what they give you. For what it's worth I currently work full time. I'm very happy with the outcome despite the classroom experience."
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,11/10/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,3,2,2,1,"SUMMERYThis is a great course for meeting like-minded students interested in web development and building a strong foundation. If you’re main goal is to get set up with a job (by the bootcamp) after course completion you will be disappointed.   THE GOODThe instructors and TAs are knowledgeable and willing to help you when you get stuckThe instructors & career services will give you advice on how to make yourself marketable make an appealing portfolio and how to answer common interview questions.THE BADYou will need at least 20+ hours of outside work per week to understand the material as you go through the course. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing but they tell you that you will only need 10 hours per week. That is simply untrue even for the brightest students.Hiring partners are virtually non-existent. Despite what they will keep telling you there is not a large group of employers waiting to hire you when you finish.Career services has input on the curriculum. This sounds like a good idea until they try to teach you three programming languages in 10 hours of class time and expect you to be confident enough to put it on your resume. THE UGLYThe instructor we had might be the most unprofessional individual I have ever met. He told us he was there because he got fired from his previous job and it was obvious why.The curriculum director and those assisting him have little regard for the quality of the material they push out.The post bootcamp job assistance was atrocious. The  Would I do it again? no Have more questions?See "
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,11/4/2016,,,,5,5,5,5,"I graduated from Rutgers Coding Bootcamp a while ago and have settled into my new life as a junior developer for a few months now.    As a woman changing careers I knew the experience would be a big change for me.  I also had to work full time during this course.Both the instructors and my classmates were great; offering support both during and after class. It really made a difference on those days I needed a few extra pointers.  At first I was a bit overwhelmed to be honest. The work load is high and some people in my class had strong coding experience. But I  kept my focus throughout the class and believed it could be done.So  it took a while for me to get comfortable with the material and pace. Be prepared to spend many hours outside of class studying reviewing and learning on your own.  I'd love to say I got a job the week after class. It didn't happen.  It took me almost 6 weeks. Like anything in life to get the help you need; you need to be proactive. I kept calling and emailing the support team; asking for advice and help throughout my job search.I also kept working on my projects; developing them further.  This really turned out to make a big difference in finding a job. To that end I really need to give a shortout to my instructor. Amazing person; even if I felt I probably was annoying at times; he always provided support and great coding advice.I was lucky to find a great job with a tech startup that also leveraged upon my previous career experience. I'd recommend RCB to anyone. But  be prepared to invest the time and energy required for success; just like anything in life. "
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,11/3/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,1,1,1,1,"Do yourself a favor and do some research before agreeing to enroll in this program. I graduated about two weeeks ago and only recently found spot-on reviews from students who went through the program before I did. From the beginning it's shameless lying and overall indecency from the student success department. The instructors were great but it is absolutely embarrassing how manipulated I was looking back especially by the student success manager who never replied to any of my concerns or messages. If you're interested in this program and find this post I implore you to do your research before agreeing to anything especially not some measly $500 'scholarship'"
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,10/28/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    Somerset ,,1,1,1,1,"Save your timer and money if you dont have prior experience. I graduated even though I did not  learn anything more than HTML CSS and BOOTSTRAP which was pretty easy. Career day was a waste becuase only 3 employers showed up and wanted people who really know what they were doing. Alot of students other than my self did not learn much because the course is rushed and the \'teacher\' is not very experienced. Save your time and money."
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/23/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,1,1,1,1,"This so called bootcamp is such a dissapoitment. I should have done my research before starting. This school only has about 20 reviews when other schools have thousands of reviews which are all mostly positive. Evertything that was thought was thought from google. When I asked where the restroom was they told me to google it. That is their answer to everything. No books are provided and the instructors and assitants dont know much about coding. The whole course should be re evaluated. Save your time and money go else where or teach your self. Please dont make the same mistake I made.The student success manager really needs to be trained better or she should find a new job. She is the main reason why the course is runned the way it is. What a dissapointment. I cant understand how they have any positive reviews."
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/19/2016,,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,1," I graduated from Rutgers Coding Bootcamp in July and overall it was a great experience. The program moves pretty quickly so you must be ready to put in the hard work. The instructors and teaching assistants definitely made you feel like family.I can not say the same for the career development and student success team. There were countless times where many students tried to get in contact with  people who are part of student success and did not get a response for weeks. I understand that there is a lot going on but not hearing back for weeks is unacceptable.Career services held a couple workshops to help people get prepared for the job market. We only had one mock interview with very limited feedback from career services. At the end of the program they hosted a Demo day where students can showcase their portfolios to recruiters. Many of us noticed that the number of partnerships that they told us they had at the beginning of the program and the number of that showed up were not remotely close. I also noticed a lot of favoritism during demo day. Instructors were pointing recruiters in their favorite students direction. Many of us stood there with less than a handful of recruiters stopping by to see our work. We were all told to print 100 copies but handed out less than 20.This program will greatly broaden your coding knowledge and you will come out of it with tools that will help you succeed in web development. On the other hand don't rely on career services to find you a job; work hard and find one on your own."
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/16/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,1,1,1,1,"The name is Rutgers but it is really a third party who runs the school. The instructors and Tas arent much help they tell you to google everything. Save your money and go to another school. 70% of the time they dont get through the lesson plans. The classes are part time but you have to study full time to be successfull. I would not recommend this course to my worst enemy. "
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/16/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,4,5,4,"I graduated about 3 weeks ago and what I have seen that putting the time the sweat and the effort does pay off. It is not easy to be good at something if you do the basic and minimum work. The program is intensive and that is to be expected the instructors know the subject and have worked in the field which helps a lot when it comes to looking at problems not only from a coding stand point but from a real enviorment. I would recommend the bootcamp. "
