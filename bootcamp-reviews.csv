RUTGERS,TRILOGY,5/19/2018,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City , GitHub,5,5,5,3," I’m leaving this review because I am very pleased overall with the RCB experience.  Hopefully I can reach one of you out there combing through these reviews that may be on the fence. Let me just say that I know what you’re going through. I joined RCB  after about six months casually looking into different Bootcamp’s in the area.  I was sold on Rutgers mainly because they are a brick-and-mortar school with over a century of history and putting their name and reputation behind a coding Boot Camp took almost all of the risk out of the equation. I also appreciated the fact that it wasn’t a 90 day program but rather a six-month program. Although it was very intense it was still very doable while working and raising children.  I started the boot camp in August 2017 at 42 years old no college degree and working in the hospitality industry for 15+ years.  Two months before the Bootcamp started I did everything I could to get up to speed from online tutorials to YouTube.   I had very little coding experience and excepted the fact that a lot of the younger people going into this program were light years ahead of me.  Fast forward six months later I’m graduating in February 2018 I win an award  and was asked by my instructor to apply to become a TA.   After a long and difficult interview process  I was getting paid to go to through the course again this time as a TA.   It’s now May 2018 and I have two  job offers. So is this worth it? It all depends on you. I made this the most difficult six months of my life and it paid off for me. There is a theme you will see in all of these reviews and it is so true. You will get out of this what you put into it.  My cohort had a 20 year old computer science student  a 63-year-old man who worked for IBM a lawyer who worked for a telecommunications firm an accountant a database administrator working for the United Nations and various other people from different backgrounds.  I would say 90% of them knew their way around computer better than I did.  I had to work extremely hard to get through this but I did and I know you can too. Rutgers coding Boot Camp  became not just a career but a life changer. ",391,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,2/8/2018,    Data Science and Visualization ,    Somerset , LinkedIn,5,5,5,5,"Halfway through the course I reflected on what I had learned and what I was about to learn. I realized how close I came to technological irrelevance. I clearly dodged a bullet by investing in my professional development.The experience was both brutal and awesome. This Boot Camp is not for Slackers you will get out what you put in. Push yourself hard and you will have an excellent portfolio to show for it.We were lucky to have a great instructor in Ahmed and excellent TA’s in Matt Han Jacob and Austin. The curriculum was exciting and the tools were immediately applicable to real world scenarios.Corey Juanita and Jessica were extremely helpful with resume critiques and just making sure we had all necessary support. This is not a program that starts stops and then throws you to the wolves it is a tool kit with a support structure. ",147,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,2/6/2018,,, LinkedIn,5,5,5,0,"I am a software developer with experience in Winforms and WPF SQL Server and C#.  I knew I had to do something else but my work kept me focusing on these development platforms.  Late last year I took on another role focusing on D3 and front-end web development.  It was a big change for me and a lot of challenge.  I was removed from my comfort zone and that led me to the internet looking for tutorials videos and eventually to this course Data Science Bootcamp. At first I was skeptical because I was afraid that I would be bored or wouldn’t enjoy it and would be wasting my time.  I kept reading through the topics and I kept telling myself that this is what I wanted to do.  After a number of phone calls questions and a lot of thinking I decided to join the class and I have not looked back since.  Not only was the class intense it was challenging in different levels.  Each student decides how intense he/she would like his/her experience to be.  The material is fast-paced but engaging.  If you feel you don’t get it the instructor and TAs are there to guide you through. You’ll be surprised at how much help you can get from everyone including your peers.The coursework is 6 months and includes SQL Python JavaScript D3 Tableau Machine Learning and so much more.  The program does not only teach you how to use each application but also shows you how to put them all together.  Coming out of this program made me a more confident developer knowing that I have acquired new set of skills.  Don’t take this course lightly but as long as you come to class and do all your work you will be surprised at how much of the material you will be able to retain. My recommendation to anyone who is thinking of taking this course is to come in with an open mind and an eagerness to learn but most importantly a willingness to share knowledge.   Trust your instructors; I had great ones – ",345,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,2/3/2018,    Data Science and Visualization ,    Somerset , LinkedIn,5,5,5,5,"Few months back when I registered for this Data Science Bootcamp I had no idea whether my investment is right or wrong. My daughter saw an advertisement of this bootcamp while doing her job search and asked me to enquire about the details and motivated me. This is the first time I am looking at the course report. I didn’t check it then and just registered for the course. Had only few phone sessions with the admission team prior to registration and after that with Student Success Manager-Juanita for prework assignment.Finally I joined the Data Science and Visualization Bootcamp in August 2017. Covering various tools & technologies in six months this curriculum is very intensive but gives a lot of exposure to the world of Data Science. I came to this class with my statistical background and some knowledge of basic Excel only. With no prior experiencing in coding and other technologies I had to face a lot of problem but thanks to our instructor Ahmed and all TAs – Han Matt Jacob and Austin. They have motivated and supported me every moment that I can do it and yes I did it.Besides this I had the opportunity to get a great advice from career services team as well. Thanks to Jessica Corey and Ahmed for the positive feedbacks for the improvement of my resume and online presence (LinkedIn and GitHub).Today I can proudly say that I did the right thing to join this program. A lot of hard work and dedication is required but not possible without this type of supportive environment and instructional staff.Again I would like to thank Ahmed Han Matt Jacob Austin Juanita Jessica and Corey for their support and patiently handling my queries. ",288,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,1/28/2018,    Data Science and Visualization ,    Somerset , GitHub,5,5,5,5,"I came into the program with no prior experience on coding and no knowledge as to what most of the tools we would be learning do. I mostly wanted to start the course because they taught SQL which I noticed most financial companies I was applying for were seeking. The experience seemed daunting to begin with but that quickly changed after a couple days of class with a wonderful professor and great TA's who were always ready to help with solving problems that came up. I never thought that I would continually enjoy going to class as much as I did and I always looked forward to learning the new materials. I originally only cared about one thing when I came into the class but my experiences here taught me that there are so many other things that I would love to do even more now that I knew how to do them. Instead of soley focusing on advancing my career in a finance related field now I realize that I may want to be a python developer instead which is a language I knew nothing about before starting this program. The program is definitely worth the money and no where else will they teach you in such a supportive environment reallly centered around making sure that you are learning and that you know what to do instead of being centered around getting graded. For someone who came in with no idea how to do even the most basic programming to becoming someone that now knows Python Javascript SQL and so much more I would say that there is no other bootcamp that can compare to Rutgers Bootcamps. Whether your a coding novice like me or someone in the field for a few years you can still learn more than you ever thought possible in 6 months if you enroll here I highly recommend it has been a life changing experience. ",321,1

RUTGERS,TRILOGY,9/13/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Somerset , GitHub,5,5,5,5,"This was the best academic experience i've ever had. Most importantly I had fun. The difficult pill to swallow is the fact that the bootcamp is everything that you would expect a bootcamp to be; fast paced challenging instense and everything else that follows. Yes it was all of the above but progress and growth was the outcome everytime. With that I grew not to mind the difficult learning process because the glory moments at the end of the day were worth it everytime I couldn't go wrong.Not only did I learn how to code I grew a passion for coding. I have to thank the instructional staff for my new found love. Their positive nature was contagious as they provided support in and outside of class. Now that I love to code I love to learn. I look forward to learning everyday; even on football sundays you'll find me posted at a panera all day. I'm eager to learn new technology in order to achieve project goals I have made for myself. This skill set has revamped the way I think while providing me with a new creative landscape of which I am only limited by my imagination.That said the bootcamp taught me how to think how to learn and more specifically how to solve problems. Yes I know how to code after endless hours of practice but I had to learn how to solve problems first before I started typing away hard coding. With that I grew confidence in myself to tackle any technical (or functional) problem I face.Overall I am forever thankful for my experience at the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. They provided and continue to provide support from every angle.Amazing Experience. ",276,0

RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/9/2017,    Full Stack Flex - Full Time ,    Somerset , GitHub,5,4,5,4,"I'll admit when I signed up at the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp I was real nervous. I was scared that I wouldn't have a great support system and I would just barely survive the bootcamp. However all those fears disappeared the second I walked into the classroom. There I was surrounded by great students and faculty who wanted nothing more than to create coders who were going to \'crush it!\' The curriculum is intense to say the very least but you're learning the basic foundations that you can continue to build off of. There was no stone left unturned with the amount of information that we absorbed.I loved coming to class every day and be surrounded by these incredibly ambitious and goal driven students. We really were a little family together. I know for a fact that all of us are going to remain in touch and be the biggest cheerleaders when it comes to finding a job.The only thing I wish I did prior to becoming a student was code a little bit more. You can totally join the boot camp having zero coding background but sitting down and taking basic courses on Udemy was really helpful to me. I just wish I had done more!  I absolutely recommend the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp to anyone who wants to change their lives and start a new career. ",223,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,6/14/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City , LinkedIn,4,5,5,2,"Before you read this write-up will be a bit too long this could be a mix of review overview and what to expect. If you're like me were admitted to the program had concerns and kept hunting for reviews a month before the class started I hope this will quell fears. It's understandable if you do its a lot of money and a huge investment but I'd do it again in a heartbeat. A lot of bootcamps expect you to quit your job to attend but RCB is held three days a week with hours that don't interfere with typical work hours which will be a plus for many.I attended the program in their Jersey City satellite location. My commute was about two and a half hours on a good day with public transportation from the Bronx but being right next to the PATH was extremely convenient.A little background on myself in case if there is someone who is reading is currently in the situation that I was in before I enrolled. I studied media studies but not too soon after graduating I realized the job market wasn't what I was expecting it to be for the field.I had a pretty good handle on HTML and CSS before starting the class as I had taken a few classes on them. When it came to JavaScript and everything else I had no idea about the technology that it took to make a website. Before I really took to dive I went through numerous tutorials and books to explore programming to see if it was for me. If you are highly considering programming as a career path and have no prior experience with code I suggest the following resources (in order of quality IMO):FreeCodeCampAdmissionsRutgers Coding Bootcamp wasn't the only program I tried to get into. I've applied to a lot and not every one of them has the same admissions process. Typically the higher-priced (or salary-based) ones have several rounds of coding tests and interviews. A lot of them were extremely daunting as they replicated the actual process of the application process for the typical programmer's position some of them even expected applicants to know recursion which baffled me. But applying to Rutgers was really pleasant compared to the other processes I went through. Some of them were so impersonal and demoralizing that I step away from coding for a few months.Rutgers started with a general info session with a Trilogy rep who gives you a run down of the program. Based on that conversation if you are ready the process starts and you'll have an interview with admissions. They'll take your background interest in the program and your experience with programming. From there you'll take an online multiple-choice assessment and then based on your score you'll have another interview session that's only slightly technical with a tricky logic question. It's worth noting that for every stage of the admissions process you'll be on the phone with someone which I did like since it added a human touch to it.After that it's only a few days before you get the final verdict. In all for me the process only took two weeks from speaking with an information rep to getting the decision and it was pretty painless.The Teaching StaffMy class was led by Peleke and Matt with Boris and Theory being the Teaching Assistants. These four are amazingly patient human beings who want nothing more than for you and your classmates to succeed. They will not only make learning code enjoyable and interesting they will teach you how to break down concepts remind you about the fundamentals and inspire you to push your brain to the limit. Don't hesitate to ask questions if you do they'll always have an answer. They are all very humble and empathetic and understand if you are having trouble picking up a concept they'll work tirelessly with you to make sure you are comfortable with it. They will go above and beyond to make sure that your projects are ready for deployment and bug-free even if it's into the wee hours of the night.With all of the terminologies and syntax it's hard to get a high-level understanding of things but with the program you'll have plenty of practice. Each class you'll have 10 or more activities that'll make use of each tech.But even if you are not assigned the same teaching staff I've had fear not as Trilogy is pretty good as sourcing their staff as they're all extremely knowledgeable and will pretty much have an answer to any question you throw at them.Your cohort is assigned a student success manager who is pretty much makes sure you're on track with your homework up to snub with the material provides info on the course and helps you get in touch with the various Trilogy Services. I haven't had to ask Kalimah for too many things but she was always great at helping me out and informing the class of changes and anything we need to do.The CourseThe program itself is excellent. The curriculum is finely tuned and top notch. For those who are concerned with only learning the newest and \'hottest\' tech and afraid that what you'll learn will be outdated have no fear. The curriculum team is constantly working on the course material and are always adjusting to what technology is in-demand at the moment like React JS. If somehow Vue JS becomes the next de-facto JavaScript framework I'm sure the team will adjust the curriculum to that. At the end of my cohort we were scheduled to spend a week (for each) on Java and Python but React JS had picked up so much steam we skipped those two and spent extra time on React.24 weeks sounds like a very long time but I didn't feel like it. Regardless of any program DO NOT expect that you will learn the in's and out's of any programming language. That is simply not enough time to master anything but it is enough time to get pretty good at something.The first 2 - 3 weeks you'll go through git and Github with a crash course in HTML and CSS. After that you'll get into JavaScript and jQuery. But right after that is where things pick-up with Node JS and the course starts getting interesting. By the end of the course you'll be comfortable with databases and frameworks like React JS.There is a homework assignment that's due two weeks from when it was assigned. Each homework assignment deals with the tech that is learned and you're given the option of doing assignments into difficulties one of them being the easier to do. In total there are three group projects which will expect you to make use of all the technology you have learned as well as incorporating anything not covered in class. These were extremely fun yet incredibly frustrating all for good reasons. They not only add to your portfolio but help you get a sense of how to work in a team version control and learn project management.Besides class time and work there are plenty of opportunities to learn provided by Trilogy throughout the 24 weeks. They do \'hackathons\' on a weekly basis typically on a Friday night where someone will teach a programming language not a part of the curriculum or go over something like React JS more in depth. These are done online with other cohorts alumni and teachers from other Trilogy programs around the country. They are really informative and voluntary so if you do have extra time outside of class work I definitely recommend doing them. They are recorded so if you miss them they are viewable once the videos are encoded and uploaded to Youtube.I haven't had to use them but Trilogy does provide tutoring services so if you do find yourself struggling with class work you can as for a 1-on-1 session and they are at no extra cost.Career ServicesDo not expect any sort of job placement from Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. From the very first day they will iterate that they do not have any sort of job placement program in place. They had workshops on how to build your online presence practice sessions for job interviews and webinars with industry folks. I had the impression that they were still ironing things out in their career service which is a real shame since the curriculum is quite excellent.While I didn't expect to be handed a job after graduation career services left a lot to be desired. There were tons of communication breakdowns or lack of. At times there were career service webinars scheduled during work hours which a lot of people couldn't attend. They did tell us for demo day/graduation that there was going to be a few hiring managers there to connect with but none showed up. Career service was kind of a mess but they were in the middle of a revamp I guess. It would be nice if they organized meetup-like events. There are opportunities outside of class to network in the area but it could be tough getting to recruiters and hiring managers at those.The TakeawaysTL;DR 
	Overall based on the strength of the curriculum and the material you'll learn I can wholeheartedly recommend this program. Learning programming is very hard and it's easy to get into the notion that it's a breeze with bootcamps promising you to be a master programming in three months. The reality is you won't come out of any bootcamp as a master developer and you won't after completing this one. There is simply not enough time to learn everything. So with that programming is hard and the folks at Trilogy know this. Although career service wasn't the most robust aspect it shouldn't deter you from considering this program you'll learn a lot and have fun doing it. *****If you feel that this is the program for you or you've already been admitted and preparing to start here are some things I suggest on doing:PRACTICE and REPEAT:GOOGLE is your best friend:Throw your ego into the Hudson River: Help your classmates out:Go all in on projects and homework assignments:",1685,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,6/8/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City , LinkedIn,5,5,5,3,"I am so thankful that I found Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. I needed a program near where I lived from a trusted and reputable source that allowed me to continue working. The structure of this program is ideal for those who cannot give the 60-80 hours/week required by many full-time bootcamps. Not only that the slower pace over a 24 week program aids retention of concepts and affords time to apply new concepts creatively. I continued learning concepts that a bootcamp does not have the time to cover and explored tech outside the curriculum. Since this bootcamp is connected with a larger organization Trilogy Education Services with bootcamps and several major universities across the US the coding community is strong and the opportunites to learn from one another are great. Pavan Katepalli is the CLO for the organization. He holds weekly training sessions and miniHackathons where I met students from other bootcamps and learned new concepts and technology outside the normal curriculum. Trilogy also provides free tutoring services for students who need assistance. I was able to begin tutoring other students while in the program and continue tutoring to this day.",189,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,4/2/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Somerset , GitHub,5,4,5,3,"undefined    This program was a lot of fun and a great learning experience. In addition to learning web development the course touches on mobile apps as well! The instructors (shout out to Dan V Ahmed and Pavan) know their stuff and really go the extra mile to help students succeed. You will learn a lot of real world programming skills finish with a solid portfolio to showcase to employers and meet some like-minded friends along the way. Also having a Demo Day where you can network with employers at the end of the program was a huge plus. But you need to be realistic with your goals and expectations. undefinedYou may notice a lot of reviews on this page are either love it or hate it so I think you should ask yourself 3 questions before you commit to this course:
	Here is some insight into the three questions above:
	 undefinedundefined    I actually graduated from Rutgers University with a 4 year degree and was in the workforce for two years before signing on to the bootcamp. I came from a Mechanical/Industrial Engineering background so I was no stranger to a difficult course load. I had a decent foundation in knowing how to code but I was missing a lot of the bigger picture parts of actually knowing how to create and deploy a website or app. The bootcamp filled all these gaps. undefined    The course felt very inclusive and it had an active Slack community were you could post questions chat with students and collaborate on projects. Having this community made it feel a lot more inclusive than my classroom experience in college. Outside of lecture there were also many (optional) video sessions you could attend (for no additional charge). These sessions included an Interview Weekly session where instructors and former bootcamp students talked about interviewing skills and how they liked working in tech. Other sessions also included Mini-Hackathons were instructors former students and people in the industry gave coding walkthroughs on making chat bots data analysis twitter bots etc. undefined    You could feel that the instructors and TAs really were passionate about coding and often took extra initiative to nail down concepts. I found my instructor Dan V to be very engaging during lecture and honestly he did a better job explaining concepts than most of my college professors. Some TAs were former bootcamp students but they are also very knowledgeable and helpful. Often top performing bootcamp graduates are asked to come on to the program as TAs.  undefined    The course is true to it’s “full stack” name. You learn how to make a fully functional website that looks good feels responsive and connects to a database. As an added perk the course briefly touches on mobile app development too. The pace is quick but sustainable just be sure to keep up with the weekly homework assignments. The homework assignments are critical in learning the material thoroughly and they also become part of your portfolio to showcase to employers. undefined    The bootcamp does not guarantee job placement. I repeat the bootcamp does not offer job placement. The course is very up front about this but you should understand how this impacts your job search. After graduation other bootcamps take a percentage of your first year’s salary as payment for the course. Rutgers Coding Bootcamp does not it is based on a flat rate up front payment. While this often makes it cheaper to attend the bootcamp has no incentive to do your job search for you.    Instead the bootcamp offers job assistance. These include resume writing sessions networking techniques (and events) interviewing skills and learning how to maintain a LinkedIn presence. Overall I would say it was pretty helpful. To get the most out of career services you will need to be proactive. I recommend attending the Interview Weekly sessions and keeping your portfolio page and Github up-to-date. And presenting at Demo Day is a must!    Personally I found the job search more difficult than actually learning the course load. I sent out about 70 applications and rarely heard back from employers. Definitely avoid the temptation of a “one click apply” approach. From my observations I would say that the best approach to landing a new job was by networking with current students bootcamp graduates and TAs/instructors. Ultimately I landed my current job by networking with a classmate. undefined    Would I take the course again? Yes. Not only did I land a new job but I now have a sweet new hobby. The $9500 was a lot of money but I learned a lot of material quickly met like-minded students and have a very valuable skillet. I am writing this review 2 months after graduation. I skill keep in touch with my instructor and classmates.",787,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,2/27/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Somerset , LinkedIn,5,5,5,0,"I have not yet graduated the course but I do feel confident enough to leave a review about this boot camp in the remaining time I have left.Prior to this boot camp I’ve had around 13 years of coding experience and was looking for something to fill any gaps I may have had. I spent months researching and even had chances at sponsorships at other schools. What turned me to Rutgers Coding Bootcamp was not only the name but also the reviews I’ve read about the instructors.Coming into the class I was a bit scared that maybe it would be difficult and perhaps fall behind but it turned out to be the complete opposite for me. With my prior experience in coding I found it extremely easy and was breezing through just about all the assignments that were given. Now I’m not saying I’m not learning anything new at all… I do pick up things here and there that I never knew before. Some of the stuff I picked up from class made my development life a bit easier.I cannot say this boot camp is taking me from zero to hero in terms of coding experience. For me it’s just filling in missing bits and pieces.For my class I had Pavan and personally I don’t think I’d choose anyone else. He is passionate about what he does shares his excitement with the class and just overall makes the entire course feel alive. I don’t think any other instructor at any other school could top him. He is the real deal and he puts so much effort into his students you cannot go wrong with Pavan.Now… if you were to ask me if I would join this class again I would say probably not. The reason being is because I have so much prior coding knowledge and $10000 is quite a bit of cash to only pick up bits here and there. If they offered an advanced course then I’d join it in a heartbeat. Do I regret joining this class? No. I’ve met some great people and hope the friendships and connections I got out of it last me a lifetime and to me that is worth the $10k.If you were to ask me who should join Rutgers Coding Bootcamp then I’d suggest anyone who considers joining has at least some background in code. If you happen to be someone who has no knowledge in programming then I’d HIGHLY suggest you learn from free online resources first. Doing so you’ll find out if you enjoy coding and you’ll have a head start if you do decide to join this boot camp.Who shouldn’t join this boot camp? Someone who only looks at the salary instead of the big picture. Coding is an “art” and people who have a passion for it are the ones who succeed the most in this field. The salary is nice but what is the point if you wake up every day hating what you do? So really ask yourself if this is what you want to do.Overall this boot camp is worth the money if you have some prior experience and are looking to turn to this career path. Just be prepared for a lot of work. This easily turns into a full-time gig for some students.After I graduate I will update this review with updated information regarding career services my job search experience etc.",569,0

The pace was perfect for teaching us flexibility and to be adaptive to whatever is thrown our way. The support staff student success manager and even tutors all want you to do well and go above the extra mile for you. I learned so much during my time and I feel i am prepared to take on something new. Well worth it!",96,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,5/2/2018,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,3,3,3,1,"I will break this down based on the star ratings.Overall Experience:The name says Rutgers but the course is run by a company called Trilogy who creates the curriculum and then sells the course to colleges.The class enviroment was good. Everyone in my cohort was eager to learn which made for an interactive class. I have heard of a few classes with various types of people which pulled down the quality of the class and made it difficult for those wanting to learn to do so.Instructors:My instructor Alex was great. He kept the class fun and engaging while covering the material and brought in donuts constantly! The down side is that none of the instructors have real world experiance working with React Mongo etc in a company for a long period of time. They either have been in other areas of development C++ etc or just recently taken the course themselves. A course should be using instructors with years of experiance with these systems. Rutgers wouldn't hire professors that have only just graduated so why allow it for these ones?The teacher's aides are also in the same boat. Most of them have recently taken the course so some of them know even less. They can assist you with the basics in regards to material covered in the course but outside of that they arn't much help and you are left to fend for yourself.Curriculum:The The Curriculum covers the basics of everything but delves deep into nothing. It's good as a kick start to get you up to speed with everything but that is it. After that it is up to you to learn about other things. That being said the course starts for those with no experiance at all and the first month is going over the basics of HTML CSS and intro to Javascript. Because of the goal of the course I feel learning all that material should be Very little time is taken to cover SQL Mongo and React.. As I said the basics are covered on how to make queries but not how to do anything such as stored procedures or other valuable features of the system. Even more disapointing is that React the heart of the course in my opinion is only given 1 week of learning. My instructor replaced the last week (learning Java for some reason) with an extra week of React. Given that the system is so important they certainly don't procvide much time to learn it. This is the main reason they should make learning HTML etc a pre req.From what I have heard of other course that is what they do so that they can start digging into the heavy stuff and provide more time with the important systems. Since this one is a Javascript course why was a wasting 1 month of time learning basics?Job Assistance:My advice do not choose this bootcamp because of the job assistance. When I signed up for the course it said it uses Rutgers career services which makes it sound like it's the Rutgers College career services but it's not. It's Trilogies on. They took that blurb down from their website after I was taking the course.This statement is a joke. I wish I could of given it 0 stars. They state you are required to complete job preperation work in order to qualify for job assistance but that's not the case at all.The person in charge of this area does post jobs on slack and tells you to apply they seem to have some connection with companies. Once you apply though you never hear anything back. All I was kept getting told was \'no havn't heard anything\' or \'going to be talking to that person next week\'. The links that are provided and the assistance they give are indeed or glassdoor search links that anyone can do on their own.between myself and someone else who took the full time cohort we only know 1 person that got hired through the career services.Tech Panels:The course says they do tech panels it's more or less a lie. We had 1 tech panel the whole time ans it was two people that came in for about 30 minutes while we asked them questions. This really annoyed me as I was expecting from their own words a tech panel every other week or so.Over all:Trilogy makes lots of claims but falls short on all of them. Sure the course does help in the fact that you can work and learn off of others but it's not woth the 10k for this course.Find a place that does direct job placement I spent 3 months looking for a job and the only thing that helped me was my previous background in I.T. Others without that will have a harder if not impossible time. ",802,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,2/21/2018,    Data Science and Visualization ,    Somerset ,,5,4,5,4,"I have been a web developer for several years. As I'm getting older I started to realize that I wanted to make a very meaningful impact for society or company. I thought I could do more beside just creating a website so I searched and researched exhaustively on what I can really do - a significant career change. I found Rutgers Data Science Bootcamp and I was very convinced that this was the one for me. The answer I've been looking for. At first I was skeptic about this program as this was the first Data Science program they were offering. Normally I tend to go for a well-established seasoned programs with years of experience. But I trusted my gut and I had a feeling I would be just fine. And YUP! I was right. It was beyond my expectation. Everything was high quality. High quality course materials instructor TAs support service and career service. I can feel a lot of time effort planning went into this program. There was a tremendous amount of support and attention for us. They made sure EACH of us was getting what we wanted and would go beyond call to make sure we do not get left behind. They addressed my disability needs extremely well. Ahmend was an excellent instructor and I was very lucky to have him. He demonstrated a difficult concept with real life example so that we can connect dots easily. His course lesson plan spanning over 6 months is well thought out and includes all the popular data science tools. I had Matt Han Jacob and Austin as my TAs. They were very knowledgeable and extremely helpful. At the end of the program you will not be an expert in machine learning or data visualization but you will be an excellent junior data guy and you will become an excellent expert in a very short time. Juanita checked in regularly on me to make sure I'm still alive and chugging along. She was very attentive to my needs. Corey and Jessica did WONDERFUL job to make sure I am a high quality job seeker and they gave me a very individualized attention and gave me great advices for my resume LinkedIn and GitHub. This is a very important thing to do for yourself. In order to make this program works for you you need to pay attention and put in all the hours and effort with due diligence. This program is not easy and it is fast paced.

RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/9/2017,    Full Stack Flex - Full Time ,    Somerset ,,5,5,5,5,"I attended Rutgers undergrad for computer science for a few semesters and became discouraged by the amount of time I had to spend on work for breadth requirement courses when I wanted to devote most of my time to computer science work.  I'd find myself in the library writing papers and doing homework for courses that I had no interest in but was forced to take.  Fast forward a few years and I saw the opportunity to take this Coding Bootcamp and jumped on it immediately.I took the 12 week (full-time) course rather than the 24 week (part-time) course and honestly I loved how condensed it was.  Going into it I thought I'd have trouble paying attention through a five hour class every day but I quickly found that most days class would end and I wished that it was longer.  If you take the 12 week course it's definitely very important to stay on top of the assignments but as long as you start the homework a reasonable amount of time before the due date it's no problem to get it finished and even find a little extra time to add your own flair to it.For a little context I had some experience in Java but it was so far in the past for me that I didn't utilize it much.  I worked three nights a week as well so it's possible to have a job at the same time but I wouldn't overload your schedule.  Especially towards the tail end of the course.  Many students had zero prior experience in coding prior to the bootcamp and while some struggled in the beginning to pick up core concepts they all finished the course as fantastic coders.  I would work with any single one of them in the future.  I just finished yesterday so I can't really speak on job placement but they have a career services department who will help you craft your resume teach you what questions you will encounter in interviews and set you up with recruiting agencies.  We even had a few recruiters attend the presentation for our final projects which was cool.Our instructor Franklin Dawes was amazing.  Super helpful always took the time to answer questions thoroughly.  He'd go over the same thing several times if necessary but somehow still managed to keep us on track with the curriculum every day.  Alan Chu and Tom Keel were our TA's and they were just as fantastic.  Really supportive people who attended the bootcamp in a prior session and came out very knowledgeable.  We had a few other guest TA's Aaron Mark Tammer Rob I'm sure I'm missing some.  They were all great too and someone in my class by the name of Adam Kwan will be a TA for the next full time course I believe.  He was an all star all semester in our class and pretty much acted as a third TA for a lot of us so I'm sure he'll be awesome.  Finally Juanita Soranno helped out with career services and acted as our cheerleader throughout the course.  She's super helpful knows her stuff when it comes to coding and is very accomodating if anything arises.Bottom line if you want to learn to be a web developer in 12 or 24 weeks you can't go wrong taking this course.  It's not easy so take it seriously but I think you'll find it less and less of a chore as you get farther into the course to keep up and more just something you want to do.",590,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,7/16/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,"After searching for two years on what should I learn next I stumbled into the Rutgers Bootcamp at first I was skeptical but after doing some research I decided to join. After the first couple of lessons I knew this was going to be challenging; see I came from a hardware background and had no idea what coding was. The program advisor told me to go and practice in code academy before the class starts and as a good slacker I totally forgot. So when the class started I was zero in programming but Ahmed (my instructor) was such an awesome teacher that I got to understand the concepts being taught to a high level This is not an easy course and it is not for everyone you need to have the drive to learn and push beyond your limits \'IS LIKE STARTING TO LEARN A LANGUAGE FROM SCRATCH\'. I just want to thank all the staff for the time being put into this course and especially Ahmed for being Great.  \'Another One\'! I will always remember this course as a life changing experience!!!!. After graduating I can say I am a developer with the capacity to keep on learning new programming languages because I have not just learned how to code in this program \'I have learned how to learn\'.",218,1

This course was one of the most difficult frustrating and humbling educational experience I've ever had. I had some incredible instructors and other students lept at the chance to help those who were struggling. I think a collaborative environment is pretty essential in a course like this and Rutgers Coding Bootcamp delivered on that one hundred percent. While the program advertises itself as one that will help you transition to a pure development I think it's easy to see that everyone -- folks with writing backgrounds like myself included -- should at the very least have a better understanding of the underlying technologies of the web.

RUTGERS,TRILOGY,2/7/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,"At Rutgers Coding Bootcamp the pace was fast and the work was intense. But thanks to Ahmed's light-hearted teaching style the classes felt fun even when I was really challenged. The instruction was clear and it was obvious that a lot of thought had been put into the curriculum design. At the end of the course you will not only know full-stack web development but you will have a good understanding of how to teach yourself any other programming language or technical skill. Really the process is made that clear. In addition to the regular classes students enrolled in the program have the opportunity to take a plethora of free workshops. Knowing how important it is to keep abreast of up and coming technologies they provided us with a chance to learn Elixir and Phoenix. Since I have a graphic design background I especially appreciated the free workshops on UI and D3.js that I was able to take. In fact alumni get to participate in a lot of the free workshops too. The entire team is very supportive of the alumnis continuing education. ",180,0

Such soft skills are easy to miss if you don't have the environment that this class provides. If you want to make the most of it I strongly encourage that you connect with fellow students instructors TAs and speakers. Though it may not be immediately apparent the indirect effect of making that effort will pay off.Overall Ahmed was an excellent instructor the TAs were helpful the students were engaged and I'm happy with the results.",119,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,1/23/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,4,"My experience with the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp was phenomenal. I had tried to learn some web development basics on my own prior to the class but I was never as successful as with the bootcamp’s guided learning. They provided the structure that I needed to make sense of a field that can seem incredibly daunting and complex for someone coming from an entirely different world. They helped me learn how to learn so I could continue even after the class ends. With all that said there is nothing that will substitute hard work and hours of dedication. The immense dedication with which Ahmed our instructor went into each class was inspiring. He really went above and beyond to ensure that everyone received a well-rounded experience. Learning to code is like learning a new language. Put the work into it and you open a new world of possibilities. Nothing is handed to you but there’s always someone there to help you if you feel like you’re struggling. It’s an investment in yourself that you have to work hard at but you’re never alone. ",181,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,1/23/2017,    Full Stack Flex ,    Jersey City ,,5,5,5,5,"I highly recommend RCB to anyone looking to get into web development. I have a background in business and prior to joining I had a little bit of knowledge about HTML and CSS from online courses. I felt like I was at a stand still because I wanted a formal and immersive learning experience. Grad school was too long considering the tech field is continuously changing and the bootcamps I found either required a background in tech/computer science or seemed like a waste of time and money. Not only did I learn a lot while attending RCB but this experience has been truly life changing. I'm leaving RCB with a very strong foundation and the knowledge I've gained is transferable to other languages and frameworks I'm interested in learning. Everything I've learned is directly relevant to what an entry level/junior developer requires.I attended the Jersey City location and Ahmed was my instructor. He's extremely knowledgeable committed and ALWAYS available. The class picks up quickly. The first two weeks we learned HTML and CSS and by the third week we moved onto JavaScript and then Jquery. The classes usually started out with a lecture and then we moved onto exercises (sometimes we worked individually or did pair programming). Like most things in life you get what you put in. If you are dedicated and proactive I'm sure you will be very satisfied with your experience at RCB.",236,1

There was an endless amount of support literally 24/7.

RUTGERS,TRILOGY,12/21/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,4,4,4,4,"I found RCB at a time in my life when things weren't adding up as they should. Do well on your SAT's get into college and you'll get a good job they said. But this \'life formula\' turned out not to work for me. I thought I was doing everything right but eventually found myself not being able to wake up happy every morning. I decided to finally bite the bullet and sign up for a coding bootcamp. I had nothing to lose.The main reason I chose this program over others was because of its proximity as well as the flexibility in the part-time program. I had to work full-time while attending the class so this was my biggest concern. The curriculum offerings were also standard with the industry. As well the bootcamp was offered through Rutgers University and I liked that I got a little bit of \'college experience\' out of it. Students ranged widely in ages profession and skill level but I found that it was a safe place to network with others without feeling judged. It helped me become comfortable to talk to other \'coders\' and maybe one day call myself that.The greatest advantage of a having face-to-face class was that if I needed hand-holding I could always find someone to talk to. But to really excel I had to be able to push past my own limitations. The lectures provided a foundation on which I could exercise my creativity when doing the homework. The most helpful sessioins were doing a timed coding test in class and doing mock interviews with live feedback. I think that whether one graduates still a novice or an employable professional largely depends on an array of personal factors but previous coding experience is not one of them. Learning is a lifelong skill and practice makes perfect; I felt that RCB did a good job of emphasizing that. When it came to applying for jobs the biggest threshold for me was getting an interview. Sending a resume was definitely not enough and Career Services was able to help me get in the door on more than a few occassions. Demo Day pushed me to get my portfolio ready and practice talking with employers. In fact I found that it wasn't difficult to demonstrate my skills and willingness to keep learning. When I started RCB in January I was despondent and unsure of what \'path\' in life I was taking. For the first few weeks I forced myself to get into the routine of squeezing in time for a quick dinner between work and class and trying to not fall behind. But it wasn't long before I found myself doing all-nighters because I wanted to and gaining a sense of accomplishment when I made that final push to GitHub for all the world to see. (And then pushing it again a few minutes later because of a bug.)And now entering into the last few weeks of the year I am starting a new job and I am a lot more optimistic with the direction I am going. Thank you to a great instructor and friend Ahmed to the best section TA's Peter and Faisal and also to Quincy for fielding all my in-class questions Patrick for the intro to Python and Peleke for taking an hour out of your time to talk about RxJS. Also to Stacey for always telling me where to park to Career Services especially Nalani and Zach who were great to work with and kept me motivated post-graduation and to my family and friends for their encouragement and support along the way.

RUTGERS,TRILOGY,9/11/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,"I recently graduated from the program in July 2016 and life has just not been the same since (pardon the cliche). I must admit that at about the 3 week mark I began asking myself if I could have gone the self teaching route that others have offered as an alternative. For me it would not have been a stretch since I have a background in IT (comp sci undergrad MIS grad). Web development was something I was interested in because so much of my prior experience had been on the systems side (process improvment project management quality assurance) and I was looking to transition my career track towards something that was more \'hands on\' if you will. Plus it's easier for developers to telecommute; systems people usually have to be at the office. Now that I've completed the program I know that I would not have nearly the amount of knowledge had I tried to self teach the skills I learned at the RCB. I am the parent of a soon-to-be 3 year old and a soon-to-be 1 year old at home so \'self\' anything is just about non-existent. I was lucky enough to be able to get to class 3 days a week for 6 months during which time I learned not only all the languages frameworks and other technologies that enable me to build complete web apps from scratch but also some intangible lessons in collaboration team building and problem resolution. Most importantly I got to work with knowledgeable personable people students and staff many of which I hope to keep in contact with years to come. As far as the curriculum I felt that the course moved along in a natural progression and at a very rapid pace which I liked - it wouldn't be much of a 'bootcamp' if it didn't. Of course there were times when I felt overwhelmed and there is a lot of pressure to not fall behind in the material. I was always able to get help from TAs/Instructors when I needed it and the career services support is stellar. I personally was able to earn myself a nice raise at my present job along with some other incentives and accolades with the skills I learned at the RCB. If you are looking for a career change or even just a skills retooling for Web development I would highly recommend the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. The format curriculum and support staff are all top-notch indicative of the Rutgers namesake. You must remember however that you MUST be willing and able to put in the work outside of attending classes. As with so many other things in life what you get out of this program will depend enormously on what you are willing to put into it. ",453,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,9/9/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,4,5,5,"First off I just want to start by saying that this was the best academic experience of my life. I have struggled with staying excited and motivated in the traditional university experience for years. Ahmed my instructor was the best teacher I have ever had. The TA's Peter Faisal Dan and many others were some of the best mentors I have ever had. Career Services has brought me so many different exciting opportunities I would have never been able to find on my own. And my fellow students were some of the nicest most helpful people I have ever met. Okay with that being said here is my breakdown of the 6 month adventure that was Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. I was in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp and graduated about a month and a half ago. It was a great experience. I felt like I have a group of people that I will be friends with for the rest of my life. That includes the studentsteachers TA's and career services people. On top of the great social experience I had a great experience academically as well. I am definitely at the level of a junior level web developer. When going into this I did a lot of research on coding bootcamps and a few pieces of advice I listened to helped me a lot. Many people that had negative reviews on bootcamps said that the pace was too much (not from RCB but from other bootcamps). I am in no means the fastest learner. Going into a 6 month part-time program and coming out a competent full-stack developer was definitely a daunting task. What I did that helped with the pace of the program was actually did all the prework plus I went over the curriculum and did some of my own additional work (html css light js). So going into the program it was if I took a prerequisite for the bootcamp. So in the program I definitely struggled but with the help of my fellow students as well as TA's and awesome instructor Ahmed. I can't describe how amazing they were. So before the program was over I had one freelance job and than since the program was over I have done contract work with one company have had numerous clients contacting me for freelance work and have went on two interviews. Remember that this has only been a month and a half out of the program. Nalani and the rest of career services have been working their a**es of to get us jobs and it really shows. Ultimately it has been said time and time again. These people are giving you great resources and amazing staff  and providing you with a great platform and experience... What you do with it is what will determine your success during and after the program. ",467,0

The TAs and instructors really care and do what they can to help us succeed our Slack community is very active and they are always on there answering people's questions when we are not physically in class. All the classes are recorded and you can go back and watch them any time. And the vast majority of the people in the class have kept up with material so one can derive that the pace is ideal even for those with full-time jobs (of which there are many). The biggest testament to this fact are the recent round of group projects which we presented for the class and were We have classes 3x a week with the students being split between Monday/Wednesday and Tuesday/Thursday classes and everyone meeting on Saturday. I'm in the Tuesday/Thursday group and our instructor Matt Kim is The instructors are very helpful and stay late after each class to help those who need it and are very responsive online as I've said but we are expected to do our best to reinforce new concepts and research things we don't understand. This is how coding works: StackOverflow and Google are huge parts of the job. Your future employer can't (yet) install new knowledge directly into your brain via some microchip or spend hours explaining every nuance of a new concept. You will be expected to know how to learn and self-reliance in this area is crucial.We started off learning front-end design including HTML CSS Bootstrap Javascript jQuery etc. and moved on roughly half way through the course to back-end development focusing on Node.js. Now we are going back to the front-end learning React. I feel as though I have a solid balanced understanding of web development and feel I've built up the necessary base of skills to teach myself any new programming concepts or languages that I need to know in the future. These days I have a strong sense of optimism about my future being excited to take what I've learned and apply it to create something awesome.__All that being said there are a few categories of people who might fall behind to the point where they need to drop out:1) People who 2) People who are 3) People who know nothing about computers or coding. The course doesn't assume much foreknowledge but it would be very wise to study HTML CSS and Javascript to some degree before coming in even if that means just taking the corresponding Codecademy classes. This will give you a good head start and prevent you from getting overwhelmed freaking out and starting to believe that you're not smart enough to learn to code.__I started learning HTML CSS and Ruby on Rails a few months before the course so the first few weeks weren't too challenging for me. I worried that the class would be too easy but the pace quickly picked up and the work became quite challenging and continues to be so. That said challenge is how we learn and I am grateful to be learning so much in a relatively short amount of time.I have yet to begin the career services part of the Bootcamp which begins after we technically 'graduate' and is something we have to apply for and meet certain requirements. I gave \'job assistance\' 4 stars because I would have liked the job assistance requirements to be less intimidating--but they are still manageable. Based on my experience with the class I expect that the career services will be very helpful for landing a job after the course ends. We have had career services talks on various Saturday classes which have provided us with great resume and LinkedIn advice.__Overall I would definitely recommend Rutgers Coding Bootcamp and am happy to have found such a great bootcamp in New Jersey. I'm wholeheartedly grateful for my experience here.",652,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,9/6/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,"I recently graduated from the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp and I couldn't feel more proud of myself.Going into this I knew the program would be intense and a lot of responsibility would fall on me to keep up with the workload. I was able to complete this program while attending work full time and dealing with the many ups and downs that life likes to throw at us.The first two months of the program were met with feelings of hope excitement frustration and an overall feeling of being lost.While the instructors do their best and will go above and beyond to help it is up to us as students to help them guide us. I realized this a few weeks in. Learning to code is nothing like sitting in class for four years to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree.In order to make the most out of the class reach out to the instructor go to office hours and practice a little every day. If you do this you will be off to a great start. Also reach out to your peers and learn with them; they are probably just as nervous as you. The work can be intimidating but let go of the fear and be open to having your mind challenged in the best of ways.Halfway through the program is when I started feeling a little more comfortable and looking back at everything that I had learned and accomplished. Take pride in even the smallest steps because they will push you even further. At times I still felt lost on some concepts but all I needed to do was put in more time to learn on my own and ask the instructor for a one on one.Towards the end of the class almost everyone was still nervous and worried about being prepared for a job in this field. This feeling is okay after talking to people in the field even they still feel lost sometimes. Coding is about accepting the fact that you will never know everything but being open to learning anything. Follow what your interest are and stay passionate. Even if you don't find a job right away keep at it and stay positive.All of the instructors for this program have been amazing. I have worked mostly with Ahmed and he has been an inspiration to me. He was always positive and helped lift my spirits when I was ready to walk away. Don't be afraid to reach out to the instructors if you are having a hard time and need support they are understanding and want you to succeed.As for the career services portion of the class they put together a lot of networking events to attend; however I personally couldn't make some of them due to work constraints. Even with this they do offer many networking experiences to take advantage of as well as assistance with your resume and portfolio.Something to keep in mind is that this program is constantly developing and growing stronger with every month that passes and every class that graduates. While the program isn't a smooth easy ride into the hands of a successful job offer I would definitely recommend it to everyone interested in coding. This program challenges you as a person as a coder and as a student. There are many lessons to be had. Take advantage of all the resources they provide to you and make the most out of it. You get what you put in much like the garbage in garbage out expression.Another huge positive for me was the flexibility of the course and being able to work full time while furthering my education. I’d also like to add a personal note from my experience as a woman in this field/program to other woman. There is a great amount of support for us in this field if you know where to look. Reach out to the instructors and career services as they will guide you to helpful resources. Don’t be intimidated if you walk into a class with only a handful of woman. Once everyone gets to know each other and the walls come down amazing things happen. Everyone was great and willing to help. Even if you do happen to come across a not so pleasant person just remember maybe they are having a hard time themselves.For anyone interested in this class don’t let your mind trick you into thinking you are less than and that you can’t do it. I know I struggled with that and looking back now I am very proud of myself for the applications that I have built and the knowledge that I take with me. As well as the friends and long term support that I have come away with. Don’t give up - follow your dreams.Update: I was able to find a lucrative job shortly after the program while the job doesn't focus on coding alone it is in the IT field and there will be times that I can use my coding skills. The decision to take this job over a strictly web based development job was a personal one as it combined another passion of mine. I am very grateful for the coding bootcamp as this showed the interviewer that I was dedicated hardworking and willing to put in effort. The excellent recommendation from the instructor helped greatly!I’ll leave you with a cheesy yet feel good quote - I know they have helped me keep going when I least expected it.\'If your dreams do not scare you they are not big enough\' - Ellen Johnson Sirleaf",930,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/28/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,5,"I can definitely reccomend the bootcamp to anyone who is roughly in my position -- I had a little prior experience doing programming and a little bit of familiarity with the unix command line but that was it.  I had never worked in IT and hadn't touched a programming language or tried to hand code HTML since high school.  The only javascript I knew was learned from a couple days of working through tutorials on Codeacademy before classes began.  My point is that I had to rely on the two lead instructors (and the TAs) to learn Javascript Jquery SQL React MongoDB and Node/Express from scratch.  They did a very good job of guiding students such as myself through some very demanding arcane sometimes frustrating technical subject matter.  They did a great job of patiently working through students' questions on everything from CSS positioning to callback functions to general questions about web development as a career.  And yes it definitely showed that they were professional web developers rather than say CS researchers.Anyway they got the job done which for me was to learn how to sit down at an IDE and be able to write a basic 'MEARN' stack web app from scratch.  Also I found the cirriculum was pretty well-designed.  It follows a pretty sensible trajectory from HTML CSS and JS/Jquery through nodejs server programming/routing/etc then databases and then finally JS frameworks interrupted by three 2-4 week group projects.  It's all javascript/node js so you get a good opportunity to learn a very popular language intensively.  I really could not imagine putting together a similar learning experience for myself through self-study or taking an assortment of online courses.So again I definitely reccomend this program if you've made the decision that you 1. enjoy programming but aren't an expert and 2. want to work as a web developer.  Don't do it (or any bootcamp) if you can't answer yes confidently to 1 and 2.  To address one last thing -- the job assistance so far has been pretty good.  I've gotten plenty of helpful feedback on cover letters and have found that they take a very active role in checking in on the job search process.  Much much better than what I experienced in my four years as an undergraduate long ago.                    ",379,0

Keep that term etched on your memory when you sign up for any bootcamp when you enroll in a university when you join a gym etc. You will get exactly what you put into this. Just as your personal trainer can't lift for you and give you an eight pack the staff can't MAKE you learn the material- that will be up to you.Time for the review: There are no books but then again this is a web dev course. Market reasearch was conducted (and is constantly being conducted for future cohorts) in order to put the curriculum together so there's that. The instructors and the TAs are excellent - they really want to see everyone succeed. I've never experienced a more accessible and encouraging staff both inside and outside of the classroom. The most awesome part is that for the TAs and the instructors it doesn't seem like it's over post graduation. There's hackathons that are planned and they're still available and eager to help. As far as the career help goes I'm still riding out out my current contract to completion so I momentarily opted out.Now back to my annoying \'ROI\' statement above. You get exactly what you put into this course. For some people the course went too slow for others it went too fast- but it's really up to you to make it just right. There are a lot of comp sci grads that take this course as well as people who studied things and have worked in fields that had absolutely nothing to do IT - I'm one of the latter. That means that I had to put in double or even triple the effort than some of my peers (this was exceedingly difficult to accomplish with a FT job) but it's what I signed up for.To me the course went extremely fast in terms of the 6 month life span. Again it's not due to a problem with the curriculumn but more of the fact that I still feel uneasy with my code as yet again this has been a complete change for me. However the learning doesn't start and stop in relation to class- you really have to put in the work. The instructors and the TAs truly care and make themselves available but it's up to you to make those 10k count.Also I'd like to give a quick shout out to my peers- they are truly a great bunch. I made lots of new friendships was exposed to many ideas and differing ways of approaching programming through the minds of other budding developers.",417,0

During my time there I became interested in software development but they didn't really have much in the way of assistance in transitioning from Retail to Corporate doing anything other than retail related things.A lot of what you learn at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp is HOW TO LEARN. So there's a lot of reading documentation asking for help on stackoverflow googling. This is literally half of what a software developer does at work in the real world. So finding answers to unfamiliar problems is a skill in and of itself. You do get plenty of help and support from instructors and TA's but thing's aren't just spoon fed to you because the idea is to train you to be able to work a developer job after or even before the program ends.",148,0

Truthfully the coding bootcamp concept didn't sit too well with me at first but as I got to talking to the people who run the program in the interviews I felt that it was a good investment.I was part of the very first cohort- the instructors and TAs were dedicated every step of the way to making sure that we think like engineers and problem solvers. They were available for questions outside class time and were always excited to help us understand and diagnose the things that were blocking progress.Since I was working while I was doing the bootcamp I wasn't rushing to find a job and didn't really rely on the job support aspect of the bootcamp.  I applied around to a few different companies after graduation and kept in contact with the awesome career advisor to talk through my thoughts in navigating the murky waters of interviewing.  She always listened carefully and gave me good advice.About two months after graduating from the program I left my job at a global pharma company to work as a developer.  I'm really happy that RCB helped me make that change in my life.If you are looking to add a new dimension to your career or change up your career and are also hungry to learn then this program is definitely for you.",255,0

Having gone through the program I can't begin to recommend this bootcamp enough. I feel as though I've been given all of the tools necessary to not only get begin my career as a developer but to become extremely successful as I continue on in the field of software development. The instructors for my section of the class were incredibly knowledgeable and were always willing to go the extra mile when I was feeling lost. I always knew that if I got stuck I could ask any instructor at any point in the day and they would go above and beyond to make sure that the core concepts were clear and that I felt comfortable applying these concepts to the projects I was working on. At certain points some of the instructors were even willing to drop what they were doing to start a Google hangout so that we could share screens and walk through code line by line together. The biggest reason for recommending Rutgers Coding Bootcamp is because they worked extremely hard to make sure we had the confidence necessary to go into our first round of challenging technical interviews. They were quick to point out strengths in your work and provide constructive feedback for areas of opportunity. Despite the many points of frustration that come with learning to code the instructors were always there to keep you on track. All in all my experience at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp gave me the skills and confidence needed to start a career in software development and I strongly encourage anyone looking to break into the field to apply for this program.  ",282,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/20/2016,,    Jersey City ,,1,1,1,1,"From beginning to the end it's broken promises. They fly through the material and don't get through the lesson plans and tell you if you have any questions to google it. The instructors don't help you at all . During the admission process they make it seem like it is a very selective process but no one is turned away. Any one who can pay the tuition will be accepted . The  people in the class are mostly high school drop outs looking for a fast way to make money. So there is no way a person will be successful in theat type of environment.I found the same course online which is totally free and you can learn at your own pace . Homework is not graded feedback is not given and when they do help they do the work for you which defeats the purpose of learning . Save your time and money don't make the same mistake I made.  During the entry process they make coding some easy and it's not. They don't offer books and everything they teach is not even used in today's market. I graduated received my certificate and every job offer I received was 14-16   Dollars an hour as a entry level developer. Spend the extra money and go to a real schoolThe student success manager is very manipulative she will sweet talk you all the way through and let you continue drowning . Once the course is over they will tell you that you do not qualify for job assistance since all the course requirements were not met.  The rules are made up as the course is made. The name is Rutgers but is actually a 3 Rd party who runs the course. They offered me to teach the course after I graduated which goes to show how desperate they are for help. I have a masters in mathematics so I know I am not dumb. My instructor that was teaching the course was a front end developer which is a entry level developer.The instructors and tas come in 5 minutes before class starts when they are suppose to come in 45 minutes earlier before class starts to help students but they don't . The deadline to drop the course is 2 weeks. The first 2 weeks are the best after 2 weeks when you are locked in to the contract that is when they really show you the course is going to be. I have shared my experience read all the reviews before making a commitment.

RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/19/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,5,5,5,4,"Full-Disclosure: The boot camp hired me toward the end of the course as a part-time curriculum consultant.I enrolled in this course to learn the process of creating web apps with Node.js. There's a lot of technology involved when building out a full-stack project: markdown files JavaScript logic API routing database management version control and so on. I tried relying on online resources to study this info but the vast amount of content available made it arduous to chart out a clear learning path on my own. This led me to seeking out a nearby coding boot camp Rutgers being the closest (30 minute drive to New Brunswick vs 90 minute train to NYC).The course focused on the various components of a modern web app and moved through this material in a cohesive direction (database management before the Express framework essential full-stack tech before trending libraries like React and Angular etc.). My instructor Ahmed Haque taught each lecture with a friendly and energetic tone—his speaking style brought down to earth the abstractions and complexities inherent to web development. The instructor and TAs always provided exceptional assistance whether I needed a quick clarification or a more in-depth rundown—they always made sure I understood the material before helping the next student. Ahmed even created video tutorials for us to view on our own time for some of the tougher concepts.While 24 weeks makes for a lengthy course the wide breadth of client- and server-side technologies covered in this span gave the boot camp a brisk pace. Still by paying attention to the lectures studying outside the classroom and taking advantage of the one-to-one support I came out able to build full-stack apps with different frameworks and databases. Would recommend to anyone looking to do the same. ",277,0
RUTGERS,TRILOGY,8/18/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,4,4,5,1,"I'm going to make this review as detailed as possible I feel as though there aren't many testimonials for RCB out there and thanks to some SEO magic this pops up first. First of all long story short I was in the January 2016 cohort of the New Brunswick class and by the fifth month of the program I was fielding a number of job offers by a number of companies ranging from small startups to big corporations. I came into the program with zero coding experience and took this course along with my college coursework (I was in the final semester of my senior year at Rutgers). No my degrees were not in computer science. Yes my offers were more favorable than a number of my friends who graduated with a degree in CS. Every single line of code I typed was taught to me by my instructors: John and Ahmed. John was my main instructor while Ahmed instructed both sections of the January cohort on Saturdays. It cannot be overstated how incredible these two were at teaching us the beast that is Javascript. John was extremely patient with all of the students and kept us all engaged into the wee hours of the night on Tuesdays and Thursdays. He even stayed after class was finished on most nights to further aid students that needed extra help. John's teaching abilities surpassed that of the tenured professors that I studied under at Rutgers University. He also has a sense of humor that helped keep things light when Node or MySQL were beating us into the ground. I would not be at my job in my apartment or in my social standing right now if it were not for John. This sounds like a cinderella story which is why you're probably wondering about the one-star in the Job Assistance category. I would give it zero stars if I could. The reason why I decided to pay $9000 for this program was to not only learn how to be a software developer but to also enmesh myself into the network of connections that was advertised to me when I inquired about the program. At my initial inquiry I was told that we would eventually be working with companies on projects to see what it would be like to be a real-life developer. Didn't happen. During the first few weeks we were actually shown PowerPoints listing various companies who were connected as hiring partners to the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. It pains me to say that these hiring partners were non-existent when it came time to look for jobs. During the entirety of the program career services would take literal WEEKS to answer my messages about any topic at all. No matter how small or big the issue. By the fourth month I felt as though I was ready to begin applying for jobs. Due to the negligence of career services I sought advice from Ahmed about how to approach employers how to negotiate a fair salary and other important things about the technological job market in which I was not familiar. Thanks to Ahmed's advice - I was able to prepare myself for technical interviews salary negotiations as well as just giving me a a confidence boost when I initially started at my new job and started feeling overwhelmed. Ahmed John and Quincy (John's teaching assistant) were the sole proprietors from this entire experience of getting me from noob to full-time salaried software developer. It is because of them that I personally felt that this program was worth it.It truly is a shame that the incredible work done by these men are overshadowed by the incompetencies and utter disorganization of the career services. I was under the impression (and given the impression) that we would be connected with a wide array of companies to hopefully be placed with at the conclusion of the program. \'Career services\' has consisted of students being told to apply for ten jobs a week and a Google sheet with seemingly Google'd job postings for software developers. A big number of the postings actually ask for candidates who are seeking a mid-level developer with years of experience or a developer who has experience with frameworks that we were not taught at all in the program. Absolutely NOTHING like the connections they boasted about at the beginning of the program.In conclusion I am grateful for this program. Only for the fact that I have learned so much and have enjoyed every bit of learning during this experience. It has provided me with a skillset that will aid me for the rest of my life. At the end of the day my gripes are very specific and if I could go back I would absolutely choose the same path that I chose in the beginning of January. But hypothetically I would hope that I would possess the knowledge I have today about who in the program actually cares about each student's learning / overall success in life and who simply does not care and will feed you anything on a silver platter to get your check in the mail. ",849,0

I don't doubt that John the other teacher was great but I can only speak for Ahmed) but also by the TA's. I have never felt more sense of security and generosity than I did in this course. With also the help by the career team you can be sure you will be helped every step of the way. If you are stuck on a homework assignment or just need help or even if you're having a break down and need a pep talk you will have access to your teacher and TA's every single day (trust me I know from experience) and I can promise you you will come out the other side more successful confident and capable than you ever thought beforehand.

Going in I was very optimistic about achieving a career change and was willing to put in the work to do so. I found myself quickly overwhelmed by a work load that I was not being trained to meet properly. I have now graduated almost a year ago and in retrospect it was the single largest waste of time and money I have ever spent. The career services were virtually nonexistent. The instructors though nice would not adequately help students with no prior experience. The group projects were a joke.

RUTGERS,TRILOGY,11/16/2016,    Full Stack Flex ,    New Brunswick ,,4,5,3,5,"I attended the somerset campus and I'm writing this review a month after class has ended.CourseFirst off I reccommend attending FreeCodeCamp.com during the duration of this course to get the most out of it. This 6 month course will quickly go through the fundementals of programming to the moderately complex web development frameworks development environments package management version control quality control database management and many other important programming tools. Since the tech industry is a very fast paced world a 4 year degree in computer science could mean nothing by the time you get out you may have a steady foundation but with older programming languages or using outdated technology. Many languages don't last long and will phase out within a year or even less. This type of program avoids this problem by teaching you cutting edge languages in a short amount of time while also brushing over the fundementals. However there is a catch. If you don't put in a Classrom ExperienceThis course was treated as if it was a college classroom with a similar grading system and strict attendance rules. You will not end up working for IBM by just taking this course with the minimum effort. That goes for college or anything you do in life as well though so this should be obvious.To be honest this is meant to be either:
	Personal ExperienceI worked full time during the course with an intention of transitioning careers from IT to web development so my workload was full but I was still able to put in the extra time after class. I didn't have a great classroom experience at this course though. I have a medical condition that makes it difficult for me to socialize. Normally this isn't a problem but I felt very ostracized here. The TAs and teacher were standoffish and rude with an exception of some good days scattered throughout. The instructor also didn't come off as well educated most of the time and fumbled through a lot of the course material. Google was my true teacher. However I did hear good things about other instructors so maybe I just didn't get lucky here.Job AssistanceThe career advisors are still sending me opportunites and were very helpful before during and after the course. They can be slow with responding during the course but that should be expected since theres like 3 of them and so many students. ConclusionMost people won't have the same struggle I had with the students instructor and TAs so I'll end with this: If you know the basics of computer programming plus willing to put in the time and effort outside of class then you will benefit from this course while possibly landing yourself a decent job and the $10K cost is a good deal for what they give you. For what it's worth I currently work full time. I'm very happy with the outcome despite the classroom experience.",460,0

This isn’t necessarily a bad thing but they tell you that you will only need 10 hours per week. That is simply untrue even for the brightest students.Hiring partners are virtually non-existent. Despite what they will keep telling you there is not a large group of employers waiting to hire you when you finish.Career services has input on the curriculum.

It really made a difference on those days I needed a few extra pointers.  At first I was a bit overwhelmed to be honest. The work load is high and some people in my class had strong coding experience. But I  kept my focus throughout the class and believed it could be done.So  it took a while for me to get comfortable with the material and pace. Be prepared to spend many hours outside of class studying reviewing and learning on your own.  I'd love to say I got a job the week after class. It didn't happen.  It took me almost 6 weeks. Like anything in life to get the help you need; you need to be proactive. I kept calling and emailing the support team; asking for advice and help throughout my job search.I also kept working on my projects; developing them further.  This really turned out to make a big difference in finding a job. To that end I really need to give a shortout to my instructor. Amazing person; even if I felt I probably was annoying at times; he always provided support and great coding advice.I was lucky to find a great job with a tech startup that also leveraged upon my previous career experience. I'd recommend RCB to anyone.

The program moves pretty quickly so you must be ready to put in the hard work. The instructors and teaching assistants definitely made you feel like family.I can not say the same for the career development and student success team. There were countless times where many students tried to get in contact with  people who are part of student success and did not get a response for weeks. I understand that there is a lot going on but not hearing back for weeks is unacceptable.Career services held a couple workshops to help people get prepared for the job market. We only had one mock interview with very limited feedback from career services. At the end of the program they hosted a Demo day where students can showcase their portfolios to recruiters. Many of us noticed that the number of partnerships that they told us they had at the beginning of the program and the number of that showed up were not remotely close. I also noticed a lot of favoritism during demo day. Instructors were pointing recruiters in their favorite students direction. Many of us stood there with less than a handful of recruiters stopping by to see our work. We were all told to print 100 copies but handed out less than 20.This program will greatly broaden your coding knowledge and you will come out of it with tools that will help you succeed in web development.

You will always feel like the course is going too fast but if you can just stick with it you'll keep absorbing and being able to apply more and more of it. Still you have to be okay with feeling overwhelmed at times. At this pace it's is inevitable.For the students that took the putting in time advice seriously I think the course was absolutely worth it. We were exposed to all of the languages and libraries advertised though some much more than others and also learned important coding best practices that will definitely be needed in the workforce. The curriculum does a good job of balancing breadth and depth of content and there is very little I would have changed in terms of time spent on topics.My instructor and TAs were amazing and definitely helped keep everyone positive when students were struggling - and everyone will struggle at some point. The career help was pretty good though I think job recommendations could be more structured after graduation. With that being said my career coach recommended a company for me to apply to and I was hired there a few weeks after graduation.If you are looking for a program that lays the foundation and gives all of the tools needed for a full career change into software soon after graduation I would recommend this bootcamp.

It equips you with a lot of latest technologies but most importantly it teaches you the skill to learn and grasp new things. It instills the confidence in you that you can.My instructors were extremely helpful and knowledgeable. No question was ever left unanswered and they had unending patience.

Here are some of the complaints I heard firsthand:
	There are many more but this is a gist of it.  My suggestions:

Material came in waves and it's basically learning something new every single day. The way I described it to friends when they asked was \'You know how in college there are prerequisite intro classes you have to take and pass for a few semesters in your freshman and sophomore years before you go onto the core classes in your junior and senior year? This is basically all the core hard classes almost every day\' However because it is challenging it is very rewarding. The instructional staff of Bob Josh and Justin were very engaging and they'll do what they can to help students understand and succeed. Ricky is also very helpful if any student needs extra help he'll help them get in touch with central tutoring to combat the material that may seem extra difficult. One of their goals is to teach you how to learn this specific material. Off the top of the head the material includes HTML CSS Bootstrap JavaScript jQuery Github Node MongoDB Mongoose MySQL PHP React Json Packages APIs and Laravel. There are many ways to succeed and you have to remember that everyone from your fellow classmates to the instructional staff wants to see you succeed so no matter how much you feel like you might be drowning in the material reach out because there is always support around. You don't feel like you're left there on an island by yourself. You will get out of it as much as you put into it. Even though the material was tough I personally like the aspect of self reliance. The instructional staff will you put you in a position where you might have to find things on your own. They're not doing that to be bad guys. They're doing it so that you yourself can understand why something is right or why something is wrong. If you were just given the answer it'd rob you of that moment when you do discover the appropriate answer. I don't want to say \'right\' answer because with a lot of the material there are more than one way to solve something and it just depends on how you. Even after the class is over it is up to you to look for and apply for your next career as well as continuing to work at the material to get even better. They will introduce the material and give you the tools and it is up to you to use them. You have to be the one to put most of the hours in and if you do you will have a way better chance to succeed. There's only so much support that they can give you to where you have to do the rest.The full time program is three months but those three months blew by. There is so much work to be done and material to be learned that it'll go by quick. I'll never forget it. I'll have life long friends because of this program.

Sometimes the pace of in-class instruction can be very fast and in order to get the entirety of the lesson the instructor(s) had to keep moving and the TAs would always stop and assist on the side if you truly couldn't keep following along as well as being consistently ready and willing to assist via Slack (messaging app) outside of class hours.  As the class came to an close I felt that we would have benefited from the curriculum being a bit more balanced.  Of course with most students coming into the course with no prior coding knowledge we required sufficient time to devote to the basics (HTML CSS Javascript) but I felt that we would have benefited from spending more time on the higher-level frameworks (React PHP/Laravel) - as these are the skills truly necessary to land a Junior Developer role.  That being said I was lucky enough to land a great job as a PHP developer before the class came to a close.  I didn't use much of the post-course career services but they are very active offering weekly webinars and are consistently availble to assist my fellow classmates in landing a job (as of today we are just over 1 month outside of graduation).  All in all there is no way I could have absorbed the amount of knowledge I did through this course in 6 months especially if I was trying to learn on my own.  This course was life changing for me - I've completely transformed my career and found what I believe my brain is supposed to be doing.TLDR; Take the course but only if you're ready to work intensely hard.",428,2

Everyone says you get out of it what you put in and that couldn't be more true. This course is designed for people like me who came in with no experience all the way up to computer science graduates. It teaches you the fundamentals that you need to become a web developer and it gives you the resources and skills you need to keep learning. Being the first full-time cohort had its cons the holidays we had took us a little off course and so did group projects. But the instructional staff didn’t let that hold them back. They constantly did their best to make sure we learned everything we needed to and took all of our feedback. They took weekly reviews on BootcampSpot seriously and made changes that made sure everyone got the most out of this experience.The best part of this bootcamp was definitely the instructional staff. I had what I call the \'dream team\' aka Bob Josh Justin and Ricky. They genuinely cared about each one of us. Josh would to stay after and help us out whether it was going back over fundamentals or going over homework solutions. Justin is an amazing example of a hard worker. He graduated the bootcamp right before mine and you could tell how much he loved coding. He’s a Javascript and git master which was super helpful to have. Bob was the best instructor I could’ve got. Going through an intense bootcamp like this it was so refreshing to have someone like him not only teach us but be supportive and care. Learning new coding languages is hard but his teaching style is the best Ive ever experienced. Him and his humor truly made my bootcamp experience.Another amazing part of the bootcamp was Central Support. In the full-time bootcamp we got 2 tutoring sessions a week. Jared was an amazing tutor and having that extra support was incredible. Central Support also gives you the opportunity to become a tutor which I did a few days after I graduated!

The experience exceeded my expectations on all counts. For my final project using a CRNA skeleton I deployed a MERN stack web application that includes browser and mobile (native) elements. The course starts with web fundamentals so it's conceivable a student could begin with zero prior experience but I had some non-professional programming experience and found it quite challenging. It was like having a second full time job. To maximize success you must read documentation and write code every day from day one and ask for help when you need it. Was it perfect? Nothing is but the product is as described and the people were responsive to any issues that arose. The classroom staff -- instructors TA's success manager and career counselor -- all very accessible and clearly worked hard to deliver a quality product.

UCF ORLANDO,TRILOGY,6/21/2017,    Full Stack Flex (Part-time  Lake Mary/Sanford) ,    Orlando , LinkedIn,5,5,5,5,"I entered the UCF Coding Bootcamp with what I would say a beginner to intermediate level of coding experience focusing around languages of C/C++/Java and a hint HTML/CSS. I stumbled on the course advertisement online while looking for resources to learn/teach myself JavaScript at home. After some research on Coding Boot camps in general I decided to go make the leap and apply to UCFs Bootcamp. Upon applying I was given a brief questionnaire that tested problem solving and linear thinking abilities along with a phone interview that covered personality and background and some general questions on why I was interested in attending. I like that the camp took the time to interview and sort their applicants to make sure they were taking in people in they wanted.This reflected in class well as fellow class mates came from all types of professional backgrounds and reasons to be attending. But all shared a drive to be there and seemed genuinely interested in becoming a full stack web developer either it be for a total career change or just general interest and to expand their current skillset. The camp is organized to force collaboration threw slack chats and in the classroom. This was honestly tough for a shy person like myself but goes with the culture they create and you fall into it willing or not but most definitely for the better.The pace of the course is relatively fast but will ebb and flow based on how the class is absorbing the content allowing classmates that are confused on a topic to get help from classmates or TA’s around them that are getting the concepts. This cycles threw out the course and a reason to be social and connect/help others and creates the group learning environment. I attended the Orlando West Valencia Campus and had what I thought to be an amazing Instructor and Ta’s. If you sign up for this course I advise you to take it with Bob Dwight or John. Bob was my instructor for this I could not have been happier with him or the TA’s Dwight and John. Whom were not only great personalities to have in the class but where always willing to help out and knew their stuff.The course encourages group work on the weekly assignments given to help grasp the content. The course has 2 main group projects of which our group stayed together for each and was really enjoyable but you are free to shuffle groups as you please within a max group size constraint. For projects you are given a list of technologies you must use and are free to decide on what to create as a team and then present them in a combined two class meeting on Saturdays. This makes the projects great and there were some amazing ideas/apps that came from both classes and allowed us to use what we just learned the 2-3 weeks prior to create something of our own and not just crank out “homework” assignments. The group project aspect was probably my favorite feature of the camp.There is a big final project which leads to the end of the course and “Demo Day”. This project can be done in a group or alone. Most chose to take on this project alone as presenting on Demo Day is a great opportunity the camp creates in which you present your final project to prospecting employers or other tech industry professionals and can lead to some great connections and job opportunities. Our demo day I think had about 94 attending employers.            Post-graduation support was great. You are assigned a career advisor to help you land a job. Zach who was mine literally handed me I think 2 interviews of which I did absolutely nothing for all I did was set the time to go in. The continued support and feedback you get from their advisory team is invaluable in my eyes.I was offered and accepted a job for a local company here in Orlando who is not in the camps network and have been happily titled a \'Jr. PHP Developer\' for a couple weeks now and using the full stack day to day.  I am also doing contract work for a company here in Orlando the camp put me in direct connection with. I cannot thank the UCF Coding Bootcamp and staff enough for their help and support for making a dream of mine come true.               ",737,0
UCF ORLANDO,TRILOGY,6/7/2017,    Full Stack Flex (Part-time  Lake Mary/Sanford) ,    Orlando , LinkedIn,5,5,5,4,"Prior to enrolling in the UCF Web Dev Boot Camp I had read a couple of reviews here on Course Report that helped me with the decision to sign up. Now that I’ve completed the course here are my thoughts.I was in the September 2016 cohort that finished up a couple of months ago. The program is 24 weeks of instruction but mine took longer chronologically because of winter break and a few other holidays in the middle. My particular class met Mon/Wed 6:30-9:30pm then we joined up with a concurrently running cohort for a combined Sat 10am-2pm session. A new topic was introduced weekly that we would slowly build on over the course of the 3 classes. The instructor would lecture for a while then we would be given activities to complete to reinforce the learning. There was also a weekly major homework assignment with the idea being to use it to build out our portfolio. In addition there were also three major projects along the way in which we had freedom to come up with an idea plan it out execute it then finally present it formally - all to practice what we might face in our future careers.For anyone thinking about signing up I would say make absolutely sure you’re willing to put in some hard work and some long hours. They tell you that you should plan to put in 15-20 hours outside of class and I would say that’s more like a minimum. I found I was often putting in closer to 20-30 hours between going over class material re-doing class activities completing homework researching more deeply and so on. The pace is also relentless. You can’t ease up because if you decide to mentally check out for a week it’s extremely difficult to catch up again. However life happens people get sick etc. so they tried to account for that by recording the class lectures and offering 1-on-1 sessions with the instructors to get caught up again.The instructor we started with Sean was excellent. He really knew how to break down difficult concepts and despite clearly being very knowledgeable and experienced was able to speak at the level of those of us with no prior experience. Half way through the course we had a change of instructors which was a bit disruptive but the new instructor Bob was also excellent. The other person I want to really give kudos to was the student success manager Ricky who was beyond awesome. He was always there to help out anytime any issues came up whether personal or class related. There were also a couple of TAs around in each class and they were always ready to help too as needed.The one place where the program did trip up was when it came to Career Services. We were told there would be many speakers from the industry who would be brought in to talk that we’d be introduced to employer partners that we would go on tours to potential employers that there would be personalized coaching for facing interviews later etc. The person in charge of career services for our cohort got promoted to a different position soon after we began and they never had a proper replacement through the running of the boot camp. For this reason while we did get some cursory help it wasn’t quite what was promised. (I know this was unique to my cohort because I’m now working as a part time teaching assistant in the subsequent cohort and can see they’re getting far superior career guidance already.) However after course completion they do have another career services division that takes over and I’m now working with them to find a good position. They’ve helped fine tune my LinkedIn profile clean up my GitHub repositories critiqued my portfolio site and more. As with the class work for this career work phase I still have to put in my efforts too by reviewing job listings applying going to meetups to network etc.Overall my experience was a good one. If I had to do it over yes I would still sign up. As others have said in their reviews you get out of it what you put into it. They provide you the tools and the instruction and the support but you have to do the work. If you’re willing to I see no reason why anyone can’t be successful.",736,0

UCF ORLANDO,TRILOGY,1/15/2017,    Full Stack Flex (Part-time  Lake Mary/Sanford) ,    Orlando , LinkedIn,5,5,5,5," I started the UCF Coding Bootcamp with little to no prior coding experience. The application process is a little intimidating. It's not just \'you can pay you're in\'. You have to go through a phone interview where they assess your cognitive skills. You also take an assessment online. Each class has 30 students with 1 teacher and 2 TAs. You meet two days a week (either Monday and Wednesday or Tuesday and Thursday) and you also have a Saturday morning class in which you join another 30 student class. Since you are spending 3 days a week with your classmates you very quickly become family.The Bootcamp encourages tight knit relationships - providing your class with a slack channel requiring two group projects and giving you some of the coolest TAs to bounce ideas off of and receive feedback from.As far as the teachers go each teacher has their own teaching style with everyone following the same lesson plan class activities and homework assignments. Whats awesome about the boot camp is they film the classes from both MW and Tu/Th so if you find you arent understanding something you can easily watch the same lesson again taught by a different person.Overall other than coding - the Boot Camp emphasizes the lifestyle of a coder. We got to take field trips to technology companies and see what their day to day was like. Most Saturdays we had guest speakers - most of them being influential people in the Orlando Tech Industry who might potentially be future employers. We were encouraged to go to MeetUps do Google Hangouts and put ourselves into the job market.As far as finding a job the Boot Camp helps you with your resume linkedIn profile GitHub Repo and portfolio. As a part of your graduation they host a Demo Day where you show off a final project of your choice to potential employers.Upon finishing they help get you job interviews with their employer partners in exchange for applying to at least 10 jobs a week. Before I graduated I was already offered 2 freelance positions and look forward to seeing where the future takes me! If you are considering a Full Stack Web Development course and want to be surrounded by serious like-minded people who care about your goals and career path definitely do this boot camp! ",387,0

Taking this class has already benefitted me greatly in my day-to-day duties as a product manager. Computer Science Student or recent grad: Looking for a career change: Much of the class is comprised of this use case. Definitely take some online tutorials on codecademy and whatever else you can find to see if you even like coding at all. It's probably not anything like you imagined it to be (it wasn't for me at least). If you find that you enjoy the challenge then go for it. I got exactly what I was hoping to get from the UCF coding bootcamp and more. The instruction and support are outstanding. On the admin side Ricky and Jodi are your pillars to lean on so use them. I can't say enough about the high quality of my instructor (Howard Salter) or our TAs. This is crucial: Take advantage of the FREE weekly 1-on-1 tutoring. It's free and it helps to have someone to talk it out with.

It equips you with a lot of latest technologies but most importantly it teaches you the skill to learn and grasp new things. It instills that confidence in you.My instructors were extremely helpful and knowledgeable. No question was ever left unanswered and they had unending patience. Our TA's were always by our side helping us when we were stuck troubleshooting but most importantly pointing us in the right direction enabling us to figure out things by ourselves. They even conducted extra study groups so that we had all the support we needed.I made awesome friends at bootcamp. The work was intense but there was a team spirit that is so very encouraging. The group projects helped me during my interview process. The group presentations taught me proper techniques to showcase my work. Our Career Director Amber is simply superb. She is very intelligent patient perseverant and knowledgeable. She analyses each candidate individually and her suggestions are tailor made accordingly. She was always available when I needed her and always extremely encouraging. Her energy is infectious :)Ricky our student success manager is a great motivator and always ready to help.I felt like I was a part of a big family and that they always had my back.Immediately after I finished my bootcamp I had to take a 2 month break due to personal reasons.

But going in to the first day my AMAZING instructor Bob and his TAs assured us all that we are in this together and will learn step by step. They make sure nobody gets left behind but I do want to say one thing about getting the most out of this program. The TAs can only do so much for you and can not always be right by your side for each assignment and homework. You have to put in the extra time and work outside of class. You can not just go home and start watching tv and forget about programming. You have to go home do more research and practice practice practice.

I wanted a change and have always been very into the idea of programming as a profession and have tried to teach my self it countless times in the past. this Bootcamp came at the right time in my life. with them having multiple locations and times it made it easy to find one that fit my schedule. Once I was in I was hooked. both the professors I delt with on a weekly basis Dan and Bob were better than I would ever of hoped for. They truely have a passion not only for programming but sharing their knowledge with others.Now it being called a Boot Camp made me prepare for the worst. Even though we met 3 times a week there is enough work to keep you busy day and night for the whole week and made it fit the Boot Camp name. There is an extensive amount of support for learning the challenging topics they cover in the short amount of 6 months. there were a total of 4 TA's 2 professors 2 administrative helpers(to answer any job/career finacial questions you had) all of them available just about 24/7. Always online to chat and each Friday they would have an open google hangout for about 2 hours even if no one showed up just to be available to dive into your code and help you debug any issues you are having. The languages that were taught are the languages that I now see day to day working in the industry They even made changes in what languages to teach as they saw the interest of the class shift. no one wanted to learn Java in my class so they switched it out with more PHP or angular if we wanted to learn that. All tools we used to communicate and submit our work are the tools used in the industry today to communicate and share work. Now this class only walks you through the first few languages (HTMLCSS and some Javascript) and after that really push you to learn how to research and find resources on your own but if you ever get stuck they were more than happy to take all the time you need to help you get through it. when I left that class I not only got a great understanding of the main languages used today but also coding basics that help me adapt and figure out other languages on my own. I have an extensive portfolio and very detailed and connected LinkedIn profile. I also am still connected with the students TA's and Professors of my class and have worked with them on projects. This class is exactly what I needed when I needed it. They ended the class with a Demo day where they invited people from the industry to come look at our projects we had to share. I ended up picking up a programming job on the side while going through the class and the professors let me make that my Final Project and gave me great advice of working on client work. they helped me bid out jobs and come up with a good estimate of how long it would take to make it. At Demo Day I was given about a dozen business cards and 2 job offers.DISCLAIMER! if you want this to be a cheap college alternative this is not the class for you! this class is an intensive coding BOOT CAMP there were nights I would go home and be so mentally exausted by the amout of learning and critical thinking that is involved.

UCF ORLANDO,TRILOGY,6/6/2017,,    Orlando ,,1,1,1,1,"I attended this last year for one of the sessions at the Orlando campus. It was a horrible experience. They do a tremendous job marketing this as a life changing experience for those with little to no coding experience but realistically it's a disaster if you have no previous coding experience.I had signed for one of the courses that had classes on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons along with Saturday morning with an instructor (Bob) and it was a fiasco. He has no previous teaching experience so he's not a very good instructor. He knows how to code but he doesn't know how to teach to code.The TA's weren't that helpful as there's a ton of students and there's only a handful of TA's (about 2-3 max per course).The worst part is that they'll give you excercise and expect you to learn in 5 minutes before they continue along and if you get lost then hey you get lost. It doesn't matter to them as they already have your $8000 (if you sign up early) or $9500 if you sign up later.There were people in class with previous coding backgrounds so they knew a lot so the instructor would pace the class around them which as a mess for those of us without that much previous experience.I got visibly frustrated a lot and one of the instructor (Bob) one day noticed and told me if I felt uncomfortable to get up and go home if I wanted to as it was only going to get harder... Really?!?! That's the best advice you can give someone who's paid their hard earned money to attend this disaster?I continually kept in contact with the organizer (Ricky Cuellar) as my reviews of the course continued being negative. Once I informed him I wouldn't be attending anymore he just sent me the links to the YouTube videos with the excercises and I never heard back from them again plus I couldn't get a refund as I had already stayed a month hoping I could catch along but it was impossible the mess they had already made.Overall one of the worst experiences of my life.

I am very proud of what I have accomplished in this boot camp but I would not have been able to do it in this short of a time without the support of my teachers TA's and support staff. This boot camp is not easy but it does give you everything that you need to get a great start to a career as a Full Stack developer. UCF has hired the best developers to teach this class they have an amazing curriculum and they give you the tools that you need to succeed. Any time that you have a question you can either ask it on Slack or you can meet with the TA's before or after class to get it figured out. The development of the curriculum is really top notch they have it down to a science this is what you need to know in order to get a job as a developer today. Of course you don't learn everything that there is to know this is a 6 month course after all but once you get through it you will know where to find the answers and how to it out on your own. All of the staff have so much enthusiasm and help you get through and to realize how much you have accomplished. Throughout the boot camp you will develop applications that you can use for your portfolio you will work in teams and on your own making applications that will look amazing and then the Career Director will work with you one on one to help you make a plan for your next step and build a resume enhance your linkedin and how to really show off your portfolio. The best advice I have for future students in this boot camp is to use all of the services that they provide you have paid for use the 1-on-1's with the TA's for help understanding concepts show up early and work with your fellow students.

I researched many bootcamps and narrowed it down to this and General Assembly. I chose UCLA for 2 reasons: the curriculumn seemed more relevant and focused and the price was considerable cheaper. I also took some online courses on Udemy before class startd which I would highly recommend you learn as much as you can beforehand.The great: The class itself was great I really loved going to school everyday. I had Clark Nielsen as the instructor and he is really great at teaching fun guy and genuinely cares about you. The TA's were great as well super willing to help and knowledgable. I will saw the limited contact I had with the part time teacher and TAs made it seem like they full time crew is MUCH better. The (minor) bad: Career Services has great intentions but its very clear they are stretched too thin and are working with too many students at a time. They are NOT going to find you a job. However it is worth talking to your career counselor so they can point you in the right direction in terms of your resume and linkedin. I think somewhere like GA probably will help you more with finding a job but really it comes down to your skills and how hard you hustle for yourself. I knew from reviews career services wasnt as good as GA going into it but I chose this bootcamp anyway.The end result: Its been about 1 month since the bootcamp ended and I have received two job offers for developer roles at companies I really like. To be clear that was from me applying to jobs on my own and actively networking and going to meet ups. I would highly recommend this bootcamp if you are serious about becoming a developer but be ready to work.

Be very careful when picking a boot camp to attend the teacher I had was let go after 3 months of work and no explanation was given to the students. Our 2nd teacher was much better but 3 months of course work was lost. The coarse work is just repeated from the last sections of the courses and the grades are irrelevant. The career help that they offer is lack luster and more of someone telling you how to apply to a job and hopefully you are in the course they build the schedule around or most of the events will be going on during your class. I would highly recommend looking into other courses the prework was pretty much useless as they continually did not use the technologies they had you download and work with during the class or they would say that they hardly use these technologies in the real world. I understand tech moves at an unbelievable rate but I would have thought this course would keep pace but they dropped the ball time and time again. If you are still thinking about taking this course just realize you can probably get this same exact material from Udacity Udemy Codeacadamy and it will probably be taught with better understanding of the material. Also they market this coarse for working professionals expect to take your career service calls on your lunch break or you will miss them Overall this class has put a very bad taste in my mouth for UCLA who I would have held to a much higher standard you also will have a hit or miss tutor that is assigned to you that is barely ahead of you in classes. The tutors are simply following along a structured plan rather than being able to teach it from their own knowledge if they are able to teach the material at all.Once again I highly recommend researching other boot camps but just know what you are getting yourself into if you do signup for this boot camp.",353,0

UCLA,TRILOGY,10/20/2017,    Full Stack Flex (Part-time  Los Angeles) ,    Los Angeles , LinkedIn,5,5,5,5,"The Coding Boot Camp experience at UCLA was an amazing experience where I made invaluable connections with both peers and professionals alike. I am known for being very wordy and rambling so I'll try my best to keep myself concise. Just as a general background information about myself before the program I'm a UCR graduate of 2015 with a Bachelors of Arts in English in Literature. I had zero experience in anything to do with programming before this experience and now I'm employed with an established financial tech company in DTLA and learning tons (DevOps Full Stack Development Automation etc).   Curriculum - Being a complete novice with all things web development this curriculum turned me into a capable programmer qualified to get interviews and getting job offer(s). There was a wide range of students in this program one was a professor in data science some in the cohort had also taken other boot camp courses (General Assembly) and/or online degrees (i.e. Udacity) some with a Computer Science degree and some who already had several years of experience in the tech industry as developers. I felt that for serving such a wide audience the curriculum was capable of teaching people with no experience and those with experience equally well. If anyone seemed to fall behind the instructor was willing to set aside time outside of their own regular office hours. One thing that one should consider is that the curriculum (even in a part-time program that's extended over 6-7 months) the topics are mainly taught to a point where you will have a good understanding. Mastery or even advanced skills comes from one's own work ethics and drive to educate themselves on said topics further. One of the many reasons why I think part-time coding boot camp was such as wise decision is that it gave me time in between the lectures to truly absorb the material and study it rather than cram it in a single day.  ----- Instructors - I've had Omar as my instructor and it was with his successful style of teaching that I was able to absorb content so quickly all the while being able to research and create more projects (I went into AR/VR games a little bit into ML but never published to public repo since it was a pet project and much more exciting projects). It was through his informative lecture and guidance that I was able to absorb a great volume of content in a short amount of time. Another thing to consider is the fact that Omar took extra time outside of his work hours to help students something that I think should be commended to the highest degree as it shows true passion and support for students' growth. Many instances of him launching Zoom meetings on Sundays or other days to review and go over any questions anyone had throughout the curriculum (from other schools across the country too). Stellar dedication and wisdom from years of experience in the field what more can you ask for a mentor?  ----- Job Assistance: This is the portion that I think many people have been pretty harsh on their reviews with. Without getting too specific our program initially had another career counselor who was in charge of our UCLA cohort. They were engaged during the first week of the course but as soon as the third week came around they disappeared and communication was close to null. It was later announced that we would be getting another career counselor already in charge of a huge program at another school. Judging simply from the background story anyone can guess that only means that this career counselor would be in charge of multiple cohorts not just a single set like it was designed to be. So why did I give this program's Job Assistance score an amazing score of 5 stars? It's because the individual in charge of various cohorts including ours Jenna Fuentes did a stellar job even with double or even triple the amount of responsibilities she had compared to the norm. Much like the course (including the curriculum itself) you get what you put into the job search. Jenna set up a comprehensive session that seemed to target as wide of an audience in the graduate pool. I think it's a flawed to rate Job Assistance low based on job placement after graduation since the junior-dev job market is quite competitive with so many other boot camps producing developers along with the typical pool of CS graduates and self-taught programmers. ",745,0
UCLA,TRILOGY,9/14/2017,    Full Stack Flex (Part-time  Los Angeles) ,    Los Angeles , GitHub,4,4,5,4,"The Good:1. You will learn a lot. You will learn important skills. You need to be mentally prepared for this and adapt your work schedule to keep up accordingly. You will keep on learning after the course. However you must be prepared accordingly. Watch JS tutorials. Read JS books. Finish the courses on code academy and if you want more preparation get the highly reviewed $180 dollar courses on udemy when they’re on sale (hint: they’re always on sale for $10-$15).   2. You will meet people in the same boat as you and at the end of the class they will be your future network. Each class has their own Slack channel for communication with each other. Don’t be afraid to message each other for help or support. You’re all there to learn and be better and more empathic developers. 3. The instructors and career service people are knowledgeable and nice. Really I’ve never met a better group of people who wouldn’t go the extra mile for their students. Go to them for support in case of breakdowns personal issues etc. and they’ll understand. They’re all very nice people and you should get to know them on your journey. 4. Resources. You’ll receive many resources on what to learn how to learn what to put on your resume how to structure your resume. The responsibility is going to be on you to go through these resources and study them and take them seriously. You’ll be expected to do a lot of research on your own especially when it comes to creating your own projects. The Bad:1. If there’s something that I wish we did more of that would be pair programming. I believe the programming is constantly evolving and they’re instituting it more in future programs but I wish my cohort had done more pair programming challenges. Some people did not understand the importance of communication in programming and I think many could have benefited from the lessons that pair programming can teach. 2. On that note technical communication could have been emphasized more. We did do whiteboarding in classes but more emphasis on technical jargon would be useful for future technical interviews at companies. 3. Certain topics on the curriculum were skipped over and I’d have appreciated them going over some SEO techniques. Some of them can be easily researched.  4. More selectivity would probably be good for the program and the students. It seems like many students couldn’t hack the program and just disappeared. Some students also stuck with the program but seemed like they didn’t learn much from it from lack of trying. I believe they’re making the entrance more challenging but they should really emphasize to prospective students that their hands aren’t going to be held the entire time and a lot of work would be required before the program even starts. The Ugly:

These courses focused on older technologies compared to this program which focused on much newer technologies.  With that being said that previous exposure was able to assist me for most of the curriculum for the course. However there were times where I really had to invest additional time to get up to speed to get better understanding on certain topics. Overall it appears the program itself is more suitable for a student going through additional Web Development training a student who is computer science major or someone who is NOT employed during the time of the course unless it is related to Web Development. The whole \'Part-time\' as how it was advertised when I joined is not really there. If you do fall in the category of having a Job and important matters during the time of the course you will need to cut and invest personal time in order to complete the curriculum and expand more of the knowledge. Also one thing to remember the learning will need to continue even after the course. Aside from that the instructors are great especially Omar Patel who is always willing to help students improve their skills and break things down with real life scenarios I have a significant amount of respect for him as an instructor. Also Jonathan Arellano one of the TAs and who has been a close friend of mine prior to the course is a great instructor who would stand up to the plate and assist Omar on multiple occasions during class lectures. I am not saying that because he is a friend other students will express the same. As far as the career portion I was not fond of there were tips that were more of opinions and unrealistic approaches.  Overall the course has provided me with the tools to continue expanding my knowledge I am grateful to have taken it.",329,0

You can't BS your way through coding; you either learn and work the long hours to truly master the concepts or you don't... Even with some programming experience under my belt I struggled tremendously.I took the part-time version of this course (~20 hours per week) but I imagine the full-time one would be similar in its approach and results just much more intensive. For half the course I had a full-time job and during the second half I committed myself fully to the course.Here are the pros the vital benefits of the boot camp:
	I attribute what I know as a developer to this program and if I had to learn what I learned on my own with no assistance I imagine it would have taken much longer (honestly a year or more). The guiding nature of this program brings you tricks tips and best practices which are small individually but over the length of the course they add up to make you a strong and well-rounded junior developer.Also please take the course seriously. It will be so easy to slack off. Imagine if you were NOT paying attention in the first few weeks; because the concepts build on each other you basically have to do some extreme catch-up OR you lose all the value you can get out of the program due to your stupidity.

This bootcamp will definitely challenge you but reward you by introducing you to new things people and ideas.  If you're here it means that you're searching around for some way to better yourself and either improve on skills or learn new skills for a possible career. I was in the same boat about 9-10 months ago searching for a place where I could learn something entirely new to help change my life around.  Fresh out of highschool I was accepted into Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's computer engineering program I thought I would be able to keep up but I soon had to drop out due to my grades and other difficulties.  Shortly after I spent 4 years getting a bachelors degree in IT and working customer service/help desk jobs not being able to break into the industry doing what I wanted to do for the next few years. After changing direction and doing web design for 6 months I appreciated the work I did with that and wanted to pursue that but only found out (at the time) in order to get into web design and development you needed a Computer Science/Engineering degree.  I kept hearing this everywhere I went so I did research and wanted to go back to school but since I already had a bachelors degree alot of places were limited and would not let me apply.  Schools not for everybody I guess right?It was then I heard about coding bootcamps but of course there was a trail of negativity and stereotypes behind them.  I looked into SO many but none of them really fit what I was trying to accomplish or I couldn't afford them or I couldn't attend full time due to other obligations.  But there comes a time in your life when you need to drop all your excuses forget everyone elses opinions and just go for it. I spoke with Alex to address all of my concerns about bootcamps what I will be learning possible career options and much more.  Alex was very helpful and answered all of my questions patiently (I think we spoke for over an hour).  After talking with Alex I was a little more at ease about the program but still somewhat skeptical. I needed to just jump in and do it.What was great about this program was that it wasn't a WYSIWYG: it was a dynamic challenging frustrating tiring fun and emotional experience (for me at least).  I didn't just learn \'Full Stack Flex Development\' or just strictly Javascript I was taught In conclusion you're going to find a lot of places and hear a lot of things.  The decision is yours but I am highly recommending The Coding Bootcamp at UCLA Extension because of my experience and outcome. ",480,0

I had Clark Nielsen as the instructor and he is really great at teaching fun guy and genuinely cares about you. The TA's were great as well super willing to help and knowledgable.

I understand tech moves at an unbelievable rate but I would have thought this course would keep pace but they dropped the ball time and time again. If you are still thinking about taking this course just realize you can probably get this same exact material from Udacity Udemy Codeacadamy and it will probably be taught with better understanding of the material. Also they market this coarse for working professionals expect to take your career service calls on your lunch break or you will miss them Overall this class has put a very bad taste in my mouth for UCLA who I would have held to a much higher standard you also will have a hit or miss tutor that is assigned to you that is barely ahead of you in classes. The tutors are simply following along a structured plan rather than being able to teach it from their own knowledge if they are able to teach the material at all.Once again I highly recommend researching other boot camps but just know what you are getting yourself into if you do signup for this boot camp.",353,0

UCLA,TRILOGY,10/20/2017,    Full Stack Flex (Part-time  Los Angeles) ,    Los Angeles , LinkedIn,5,5,5,5,"The Coding Boot Camp experience at UCLA was an amazing experience where I made invaluable connections with both peers and professionals alike. I am known for being very wordy and rambling so I'll try my best to keep myself concise. Just as a general background information about myself before the program I'm a UCR graduate of 2015 with a Bachelors of Arts in English in Literature. I had zero experience in anything to do with programming before this experience and now I'm employed with an established financial tech company in DTLA and learning tons (DevOps Full Stack Development Automation etc).   Curriculum - Being a complete novice with all things web development this curriculum turned me into a capable programmer qualified to get interviews and getting job offer(s). There was a wide range of students in this program one was a professor in data science some in the cohort had also taken other boot camp courses (General Assembly) and/or online degrees (i.e. Udacity) some with a Computer Science degree and some who already had several years of experience in the tech industry as developers. I felt that for serving such a wide audience the curriculum was capable of teaching people with no experience and those with experience equally well. If anyone seemed to fall behind the instructor was willing to set aside time outside of their own regular office hours. One thing that one should consider is that the curriculum (even in a part-time program that's extended over 6-7 months) the topics are mainly taught to a point where you will have a good understanding. Mastery or even advanced skills comes from one's own work ethics and drive to educate themselves on said topics further. One of the many reasons why I think part-time coding boot camp was such as wise decision is that it gave me time in between the lectures to truly absorb the material and study it rather than cram it in a single day.  ----- Instructors - I've had Omar as my instructor and it was with his successful style of teaching that I was able to absorb content so quickly all the while being able to research and create more projects (I went into AR/VR games a little bit into ML but never published to public repo since it was a pet project and much more exciting projects). It was through his informative lecture and guidance that I was able to absorb a great volume of content in a short amount of time. Another thing to consider is the fact that Omar took extra time outside of his work hours to help students something that I think should be commended to the highest degree as it shows true passion and support for students' growth. Many instances of him launching Zoom meetings on Sundays or other days to review and go over any questions anyone had throughout the curriculum (from other schools across the country too). Stellar dedication and wisdom from years of experience in the field what more can you ask for a mentor?  ----- Job Assistance: This is the portion that I think many people have been pretty harsh on their reviews with. Without getting too specific our program initially had another career counselor who was in charge of our UCLA cohort. They were engaged during the first week of the course but as soon as the third week came around they disappeared and communication was close to null. It was later announced that we would be getting another career counselor already in charge of a huge program at another school. Judging simply from the background story anyone can guess that only means that this career counselor would be in charge of multiple cohorts not just a single set like it was designed to be. So why did I give this program's Job Assistance score an amazing score of 5 stars? It's because the individual in charge of various cohorts including ours Jenna Fuentes did a stellar job even with double or even triple the amount of responsibilities she had compared to the norm. Much like the course (including the curriculum itself) you get what you put into the job search. Jenna set up a comprehensive session that seemed to target as wide of an audience in the graduate pool. I think it's a flawed to rate Job Assistance low based on job placement after graduation since the junior-dev job market is quite competitive with so many other boot camps producing developers along with the typical pool of CS graduates and self-taught programmers. ",745,0
UCLA,TRILOGY,9/14/2017,    Full Stack Flex (Part-time  Los Angeles) ,    Los Angeles , GitHub,4,4,5,4,"The Good:1. You will learn a lot. You will learn important skills. You need to be mentally prepared for this and adapt your work schedule to keep up accordingly. You will keep on learning after the course. However you must be prepared accordingly. Watch JS tutorials. Read JS books. Finish the courses on code academy and if you want more preparation get the highly reviewed $180 dollar courses on udemy when they’re on sale (hint: they’re always on sale for $10-$15).   2. You will meet people in the same boat as you and at the end of the class they will be your future network. Each class has their own Slack channel for communication with each other. Don’t be afraid to message each other for help or support. You’re all there to learn and be better and more empathic developers. 3. The instructors and career service people are knowledgeable and nice. Really I’ve never met a better group of people who wouldn’t go the extra mile for their students. Go to them for support in case of breakdowns personal issues etc. and they’ll understand. They’re all very nice people and you should get to know them on your journey. 4. Resources. You’ll receive many resources on what to learn how to learn what to put on your resume how to structure your resume. The responsibility is going to be on you to go through these resources and study them and take them seriously. You’ll be expected to do a lot of research on your own especially when it comes to creating your own projects. The Bad:1. If there’s something that I wish we did more of that would be pair programming. I believe the programming is constantly evolving and they’re instituting it more in future programs but I wish my cohort had done more pair programming challenges. Some people did not understand the importance of communication in programming and I think many could have benefited from the lessons that pair programming can teach. 2. On that note technical communication could have been emphasized more. We did do whiteboarding in classes but more emphasis on technical jargon would be useful for future technical interviews at companies. 3. Certain topics on the curriculum were skipped over and I’d have appreciated them going over some SEO techniques. Some of them can be easily researched.  4. More selectivity would probably be good for the program and the students. It seems like many students couldn’t hack the program and just disappeared. Some students also stuck with the program but seemed like they didn’t learn much from it from lack of trying. I believe they’re making the entrance more challenging but they should really emphasize to prospective students that their hands aren’t going to be held the entire time and a lot of work would be required before the program even starts. The Ugly:

These courses focused on older technologies compared to this program which focused on much newer technologies.  With that being said that previous exposure was able to assist me for most of the curriculum for the course. However there were times where I really had to invest additional time to get up to speed to get better understanding on certain topics. Overall it appears the program itself is more suitable for a student going through additional Web Development training a student who is computer science major or someone who is NOT employed during the time of the course unless it is related to Web Development. The whole \'Part-time\' as how it was advertised when I joined is not really there. If you do fall in the category of having a Job and important matters during the time of the course you will need to cut and invest personal time in order to complete the curriculum and expand more of the knowledge. Also one thing to remember the learning will need to continue even after the course. Aside from that the instructors are great especially Omar Patel who is always willing to help students improve their skills and break things down with real life scenarios I have a significant amount of respect for him as an instructor. Also Jonathan Arellano one of the TAs and who has been a close friend of mine prior to the course is a great instructor who would stand up to the plate and assist Omar on multiple occasions during class lectures. I am not saying that because he is a friend other students will express the same.

You can't BS your way through coding; you either learn and work the long hours to truly master the concepts or you don't... Even with some programming experience under my belt I struggled tremendously.I took the part-time version of this course (~20 hours per week) but I imagine the full-time one would be similar in its approach and results just much more intensive. For half the course I had a full-time job and during the second half I committed myself fully to the course.Here are the pros the vital benefits of the boot camp:
	I attribute what I know as a developer to this program and if I had to learn what I learned on my own with no assistance I imagine it would have taken much longer (honestly a year or more). The guiding nature of this program brings you tricks tips and best practices which are small individually but over the length of the course they add up to make you a strong and well-rounded junior developer.Also please take the course seriously. It will be so easy to slack off. Imagine if you were NOT paying attention in the first few weeks; because the concepts build on each other you basically have to do some extreme catch-up OR you lose all the value you can get out of the program due to your stupidity.

This bootcamp will definitely challenge you but reward you by introducing you to new things people and ideas.  If you're here it means that you're searching around for some way to better yourself and either improve on skills or learn new skills for a possible career. I was in the same boat about 9-10 months ago searching for a place where I could learn something entirely new to help change my life around.  Fresh out of highschool I was accepted into Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's computer engineering program I thought I would be able to keep up but I soon had to drop out due to my grades and other difficulties.  Shortly after I spent 4 years getting a bachelors degree in IT and working customer service/help desk jobs not being able to break into the industry doing what I wanted to do for the next few years. After changing direction and doing web design for 6 months I appreciated the work I did with that and wanted to pursue that but only found out (at the time) in order to get into web design and development you needed a Computer Science/Engineering degree.  I kept hearing this everywhere I went so I did research and wanted to go back to school but since I already had a bachelors degree alot of places were limited and would not let me apply.  Schools not for everybody I guess right?It was then I heard about coding bootcamps but of course there was a trail of negativity and stereotypes behind them.  I looked into SO many but none of them really fit what I was trying to accomplish or I couldn't afford them or I couldn't attend full time due to other obligations.  But there comes a time in your life when you need to drop all your excuses forget everyone elses opinions and just go for it. I spoke with Alex to address all of my concerns about bootcamps what I will be learning possible career options and much more.  Alex was very helpful and answered all of my questions patiently (I think we spoke for over an hour).  After talking with Alex I was a little more at ease about the program but still somewhat skeptical. I needed to just jump in and do it.What was great about this program was that it wasn't a WYSIWYG: it was a dynamic challenging frustrating tiring fun and emotional experience (for me at least).  I didn't just learn \'Full Stack Flex Development\' or just strictly Javascript I was taught In conclusion you're going to find a lot of places and hear a lot of things.  The decision is yours but I am highly recommending The Coding Bootcamp at UCLA Extension because of my experience and outcome. ",480,0

Be very careful when picking a boot camp to attend the teacher I had was let go after 3 months of work and no explanation was given to the students. Our 2nd teacher was much better but 3 months of course work was lost. The coarse work is just repeated from the last sections of the courses and the grades are irrelevant. The career help that they offer is lack luster and more of someone telling you how to apply to a job and hopefully you are in the course they build the schedule around or most of the events will be going on during your class. I would highly recommend looking into other courses the prework was pretty much useless as they continually did not use the technologies they had you download and work with during the class or they would say that they hardly use these technologies in the real world. I understand tech moves at an unbelievable rate but I would have thought this course would keep pace but they dropped the ball time and time again. If you are still thinking about taking this course just realize you can probably get this same exact material from Udacity Udemy Codeacadamy and it will probably be taught with better understanding of the material. Also they market this coarse for working professionals expect to take your career service calls on your lunch break or you will miss them Overall this class has put a very bad taste in my mouth for UCLA who I would have held to a much higher standard you also will have a hit or miss tutor that is assigned to you that is barely ahead of you in classes. The tutors are simply following along a structured plan rather than being able to teach it from their own knowledge if they are able to teach the material at all.Once again I highly recommend researching other boot camps but just know what you are getting yourself into if you do signup for this boot camp.",353,0

UCLA,TRILOGY,10/20/2017,    Full Stack Flex (Part-time  Los Angeles) ,    Los Angeles , LinkedIn,5,5,5,5,"The Coding Boot Camp experience at UCLA was an amazing experience where I made invaluable connections with both peers and professionals alike. I am known for being very wordy and rambling so I'll try my best to keep myself concise. Just as a general background information about myself before the program I'm a UCR graduate of 2015 with a Bachelors of Arts in English in Literature. I had zero experience in anything to do with programming before this experience and now I'm employed with an established financial tech company in DTLA and learning tons (DevOps Full Stack Development Automation etc).   Curriculum - Being a complete novice with all things web development this curriculum turned me into a capable programmer qualified to get interviews and getting job offer(s). There was a wide range of students in this program one was a professor in data science some in the cohort had also taken other boot camp courses (General Assembly) and/or online degrees (i.e. Udacity) some with a Computer Science degree and some who already had several years of experience in the tech industry as developers. I felt that for serving such a wide audience the curriculum was capable of teaching people with no experience and those with experience equally well. If anyone seemed to fall behind the instructor was willing to set aside time outside of their own regular office hours. One thing that one should consider is that the curriculum (even in a part-time program that's extended over 6-7 months) the topics are mainly taught to a point where you will have a good understanding. Mastery or even advanced skills comes from one's own work ethics and drive to educate themselves on said topics further. One of the many reasons why I think part-time coding boot camp was such as wise decision is that it gave me time in between the lectures to truly absorb the material and study it rather than cram it in a single day.  ----- Instructors - I've had Omar as my instructor and it was with his successful style of teaching that I was able to absorb content so quickly all the while being able to research and create more projects (I went into AR/VR games a little bit into ML but never published to public repo since it was a pet project and much more exciting projects). It was through his informative lecture and guidance that I was able to absorb a great volume of content in a short amount of time. Another thing to consider is the fact that Omar took extra time outside of his work hours to help students something that I think should be commended to the highest degree as it shows true passion and support for students' growth. Many instances of him launching Zoom meetings on Sundays or other days to review and go over any questions anyone had throughout the curriculum (from other schools across the country too). Stellar dedication and wisdom from years of experience in the field what more can you ask for a mentor?  ----- Job Assistance: This is the portion that I think many people have been pretty harsh on their reviews with. Without getting too specific our program initially had another career counselor who was in charge of our UCLA cohort. They were engaged during the first week of the course but as soon as the third week came around they disappeared and communication was close to null. It was later announced that we would be getting another career counselor already in charge of a huge program at another school. Judging simply from the background story anyone can guess that only means that this career counselor would be in charge of multiple cohorts not just a single set like it was designed to be. So why did I give this program's Job Assistance score an amazing score of 5 stars? It's because the individual in charge of various cohorts including ours Jenna Fuentes did a stellar job even with double or even triple the amount of responsibilities she had compared to the norm. Much like the course (including the curriculum itself) you get what you put into the job search. Jenna set up a comprehensive session that seemed to target as wide of an audience in the graduate pool. I think it's a flawed to rate Job Assistance low based on job placement after graduation since the junior-dev job market is quite competitive with so many other boot camps producing developers along with the typical pool of CS graduates and self-taught programmers. ",745,0
UCLA,TRILOGY,9/14/2017,    Full Stack Flex (Part-time  Los Angeles) ,    Los Angeles , GitHub,4,4,5,4,"The Good:1. You will learn a lot. You will learn important skills. You need to be mentally prepared for this and adapt your work schedule to keep up accordingly. You will keep on learning after the course. However you must be prepared accordingly. Watch JS tutorials. Read JS books. Finish the courses on code academy and if you want more preparation get the highly reviewed $180 dollar courses on udemy when they’re on sale (hint: they’re always on sale for $10-$15).   2. You will meet people in the same boat as you and at the end of the class they will be your future network. Each class has their own Slack channel for communication with each other. Don’t be afraid to message each other for help or support. You’re all there to learn and be better and more empathic developers. 3. The instructors and career service people are knowledgeable and nice. Really I’ve never met a better group of people who wouldn’t go the extra mile for their students. Go to them for support in case of breakdowns personal issues etc. and they’ll understand. They’re all very nice people and you should get to know them on your journey. 4. Resources. You’ll receive many resources on what to learn how to learn what to put on your resume how to structure your resume. The responsibility is going to be on you to go through these resources and study them and take them seriously. You’ll be expected to do a lot of research on your own especially when it comes to creating your own projects. The Bad:1. If there’s something that I wish we did more of that would be pair programming. I believe the programming is constantly evolving and they’re instituting it more in future programs but I wish my cohort had done more pair programming challenges. Some people did not understand the importance of communication in programming and I think many could have benefited from the lessons that pair programming can teach. 2. On that note technical communication could have been emphasized more. We did do whiteboarding in classes but more emphasis on technical jargon would be useful for future technical interviews at companies. 3. Certain topics on the curriculum were skipped over and I’d have appreciated them going over some SEO techniques. Some of them can be easily researched.  4. More selectivity would probably be good for the program and the students. It seems like many students couldn’t hack the program and just disappeared. Some students also stuck with the program but seemed like they didn’t learn much from it from lack of trying. I believe they’re making the entrance more challenging but they should really emphasize to prospective students that their hands aren’t going to be held the entire time and a lot of work would be required before the program even starts. The Ugly:

These courses focused on older technologies compared to this program which focused on much newer technologies.  With that being said that previous exposure was able to assist me for most of the curriculum for the course. However there were times where I really had to invest additional time to get up to speed to get better understanding on certain topics. Overall it appears the program itself is more suitable for a student going through additional Web Development training a student who is computer science major or someone who is NOT employed during the time of the course unless it is related to Web Development. The whole \'Part-time\' as how it was advertised when I joined is not really there. If you do fall in the category of having a Job and important matters during the time of the course you will need to cut and invest personal time in order to complete the curriculum and expand more of the knowledge. Also one thing to remember the learning will need to continue even after the course. Aside from that the instructors are great especially Omar Patel who is always willing to help students improve their skills and break things down with real life scenarios I have a significant amount of respect for him as an instructor. Also Jonathan Arellano one of the TAs and who has been a close friend of mine prior to the course is a great instructor who would stand up to the plate and assist Omar on multiple occasions during class lectures. I am not saying that because he is a friend other students will express the same. As far as the career portion I was not fond of there were tips that were more of opinions and unrealistic approaches.  Overall the course has provided me with the tools to continue expanding my knowledge I am grateful to have taken it.",329,0

You can't BS your way through coding; you either learn and work the long hours to truly master the concepts or you don't... Even with some programming experience under my belt I struggled tremendously.I took the part-time version of this course (~20 hours per week) but I imagine the full-time one would be similar in its approach and results just much more intensive. For half the course I had a full-time job and during the second half I committed myself fully to the course.Here are the pros the vital benefits of the boot camp:
	I attribute what I know as a developer to this program and if I had to learn what I learned on my own with no assistance I imagine it would have taken much longer (honestly a year or more). The guiding nature of this program brings you tricks tips and best practices which are small individually but over the length of the course they add up to make you a strong and well-rounded junior developer.Also please take the course seriously. It will be so easy to slack off. Imagine if you were NOT paying attention in the first few weeks; because the concepts build on each other you basically have to do some extreme catch-up OR you lose all the value you can get out of the program due to your stupidity.

I was in the same boat about 9-10 months ago searching for a place where I could learn something entirely new to help change my life around.  Fresh out of highschool I was accepted into Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's computer engineering program I thought I would be able to keep up but I soon had to drop out due to my grades and other difficulties.  Shortly after I spent 4 years getting a bachelors degree in IT and working customer service/help desk jobs not being able to break into the industry doing what I wanted to do for the next few years. After changing direction and doing web design for 6 months I appreciated the work I did with that and wanted to pursue that but only found out (at the time) in order to get into web design and development you needed a Computer Science/Engineering degree.  I kept hearing this everywhere I went so I did research and wanted to go back to school but since I already had a bachelors degree alot of places were limited and would not let me apply.  Schools not for everybody I guess right?It was then I heard about coding bootcamps but of course there was a trail of negativity and stereotypes behind them.  I looked into SO many but none of them really fit what I was trying to accomplish or I couldn't afford them or I couldn't attend full time due to other obligations.  But there comes a time in your life when you need to drop all your excuses forget everyone elses opinions and just go for it. I spoke with Alex to address all of my concerns about bootcamps what I will be learning possible career options and much more.  Alex was very helpful and answered all of my questions patiently (I think we spoke for over an hour).  After talking with Alex I was a little more at ease about the program but still somewhat skeptical. I needed to just jump in and do it.What was great about this program was that it wasn't a WYSIWYG: it was a dynamic challenging frustrating tiring fun and emotional experience (for me at least).  I didn't just learn \'Full Stack Flex Development\' or just strictly Javascript I was taught In conclusion you're going to find a lot of places and hear a lot of things.  The decision is yours but I am highly recommending The Coding Bootcamp at UCLA Extension because of my experience and outcome. ",480,0

To be clear that was from me applying to jobs on my own and actively networking and going to meet ups. I would highly recommend this bootcamp if you are serious about becoming a developer but be ready to work. Theres nothing magical that happens at bootcamp you have to make it happen for yourself by learnin and networking but this will provide you with the knowledge you need to be succesful.",348,0

Be very careful when picking a boot camp to attend the teacher I had was let go after 3 months of work and no explanation was given to the students. Our 2nd teacher was much better but 3 months of course work was lost. The coarse work is just repeated from the last sections of the courses and the grades are irrelevant. The career help that they offer is lack luster and more of someone telling you how to apply to a job and hopefully you are in the course they build the schedule around or most of the events will be going on during your class. I would highly recommend looking into other courses the prework was pretty much useless as they continually did not use the technologies they had you download and work with during the class or they would say that they hardly use these technologies in the real world. I understand tech moves at an unbelievable rate but I would have thought this course would keep pace but they dropped the ball time and time again. If you are still thinking about taking this course just realize you can probably get this same exact material from Udacity Udemy Codeacadamy and it will probably be taught with better understanding of the material. Also they market this coarse for working professionals expect to take your career service calls on your lunch break or you will miss them Overall this class has put a very bad taste in my mouth for UCLA who I would have held to a much higher standard you also will have a hit or miss tutor that is assigned to you that is barely ahead of you in classes. The tutors are simply following along a structured plan rather than being able to teach it from their own knowledge if they are able to teach the material at all.Once again I highly recommend researching other boot camps but just know what you are getting yourself into if you do signup for this boot camp.",353,0

UCLA,TRILOGY,10/20/2017,    Full Stack Flex (Part-time  Los Angeles) ,    Los Angeles , LinkedIn,5,5,5,5,"The Coding Boot Camp experience at UCLA was an amazing experience where I made invaluable connections with both peers and professionals alike. I am known for being very wordy and rambling so I'll try my best to keep myself concise. Just as a general background information about myself before the program I'm a UCR graduate of 2015 with a Bachelors of Arts in English in Literature. I had zero experience in anything to do with programming before this experience and now I'm employed with an established financial tech company in DTLA and learning tons (DevOps Full Stack Development Automation etc).   Curriculum - Being a complete novice with all things web development this curriculum turned me into a capable programmer qualified to get interviews and getting job offer(s). There was a wide range of students in this program one was a professor in data science some in the cohort had also taken other boot camp courses (General Assembly) and/or online degrees (i.e. Udacity) some with a Computer Science degree and some who already had several years of experience in the tech industry as developers. I felt that for serving such a wide audience the curriculum was capable of teaching people with no experience and those with experience equally well. If anyone seemed to fall behind the instructor was willing to set aside time outside of their own regular office hours. One thing that one should consider is that the curriculum (even in a part-time program that's extended over 6-7 months) the topics are mainly taught to a point where you will have a good understanding. Mastery or even advanced skills comes from one's own work ethics and drive to educate themselves on said topics further. One of the many reasons why I think part-time coding boot camp was such as wise decision is that it gave me time in between the lectures to truly absorb the material and study it rather than cram it in a single day.  ----- Instructors - I've had Omar as my instructor and it was with his successful style of teaching that I was able to absorb content so quickly all the while being able to research and create more projects (I went into AR/VR games a little bit into ML but never published to public repo since it was a pet project and much more exciting projects). It was through his informative lecture and guidance that I was able to absorb a great volume of content in a short amount of time. Another thing to consider is the fact that Omar took extra time outside of his work hours to help students something that I think should be commended to the highest degree as it shows true passion and support for students' growth. Many instances of him launching Zoom meetings on Sundays or other days to review and go over any questions anyone had throughout the curriculum (from other schools across the country too). Stellar dedication and wisdom from years of experience in the field what more can you ask for a mentor?  ----- Job Assistance: This is the portion that I think many people have been pretty harsh on their reviews with. Without getting too specific our program initially had another career counselor who was in charge of our UCLA cohort. They were engaged during the first week of the course but as soon as the third week came around they disappeared and communication was close to null. It was later announced that we would be getting another career counselor already in charge of a huge program at another school. Judging simply from the background story anyone can guess that only means that this career counselor would be in charge of multiple cohorts not just a single set like it was designed to be. So why did I give this program's Job Assistance score an amazing score of 5 stars? It's because the individual in charge of various cohorts including ours Jenna Fuentes did a stellar job even with double or even triple the amount of responsibilities she had compared to the norm. Much like the course (including the curriculum itself) you get what you put into the job search. Jenna set up a comprehensive session that seemed to target as wide of an audience in the graduate pool. I think it's a flawed to rate Job Assistance low based on job placement after graduation since the junior-dev job market is quite competitive with so many other boot camps producing developers along with the typical pool of CS graduates and self-taught programmers. ",745,0
UCLA,TRILOGY,9/14/2017,    Full Stack Flex (Part-time  Los Angeles) ,    Los Angeles , GitHub,4,4,5,4,"The Good:1. You will learn a lot. You will learn important skills. You need to be mentally prepared for this and adapt your work schedule to keep up accordingly. You will keep on learning after the course. However you must be prepared accordingly. Watch JS tutorials. Read JS books. Finish the courses on code academy and if you want more preparation get the highly reviewed $180 dollar courses on udemy when they’re on sale (hint: they’re always on sale for $10-$15).   2. You will meet people in the same boat as you and at the end of the class they will be your future network. Each class has their own Slack channel for communication with each other. Don’t be afraid to message each other for help or support. You’re all there to learn and be better and more empathic developers. 3. The instructors and career service people are knowledgeable and nice. Really I’ve never met a better group of people who wouldn’t go the extra mile for their students. Go to them for support in case of breakdowns personal issues etc. and they’ll understand. They’re all very nice people and you should get to know them on your journey. 4. Resources. You’ll receive many resources on what to learn how to learn what to put on your resume how to structure your resume. The responsibility is going to be on you to go through these resources and study them and take them seriously. You’ll be expected to do a lot of research on your own especially when it comes to creating your own projects. The Bad:1. If there’s something that I wish we did more of that would be pair programming. I believe the programming is constantly evolving and they’re instituting it more in future programs but I wish my cohort had done more pair programming challenges. Some people did not understand the importance of communication in programming and I think many could have benefited from the lessons that pair programming can teach. 2. On that note technical communication could have been emphasized more. We did do whiteboarding in classes but more emphasis on technical jargon would be useful for future technical interviews at companies. 3. Certain topics on the curriculum were skipped over and I’d have appreciated them going over some SEO techniques. Some of them can be easily researched.  4. More selectivity would probably be good for the program and the students. It seems like many students couldn’t hack the program and just disappeared. Some students also stuck with the program but seemed like they didn’t learn much from it from lack of trying. I believe they’re making the entrance more challenging but they should really emphasize to prospective students that their hands aren’t going to be held the entire time and a lot of work would be required before the program even starts. The Ugly:

These courses focused on older technologies compared to this program which focused on much newer technologies.  With that being said that previous exposure was able to assist me for most of the curriculum for the course. However there were times where I really had to invest additional time to get up to speed to get better understanding on certain topics. Overall it appears the program itself is more suitable for a student going through additional Web Development training a student who is computer science major or someone who is NOT employed during the time of the course unless it is related to Web Development. The whole \'Part-time\' as how it was advertised when I joined is not really there. If you do fall in the category of having a Job and important matters during the time of the course you will need to cut and invest personal time in order to complete the curriculum and expand more of the knowledge. Also one thing to remember the learning will need to continue even after the course. Aside from that the instructors are great especially Omar Patel who is always willing to help students improve their skills and break things down with real life scenarios I have a significant amount of respect for him as an instructor. Also Jonathan Arellano one of the TAs and who has been a close friend of mine prior to the course is a great instructor who would stand up to the plate and assist Omar on multiple occasions during class lectures. I am not saying that because he is a friend other students will express the same. As far as the career portion I was not fond of there were tips that were more of opinions and unrealistic approaches.  Overall the course has provided me with the tools to continue expanding my knowledge I am grateful to have taken it.",329,0

You can't BS your way through coding; you either learn and work the long hours to truly master the concepts or you don't... Even with some programming experience under my belt I struggled tremendously.I took the part-time version of this course (~20 hours per week) but I imagine the full-time one would be similar in its approach and results just much more intensive. For half the course I had a full-time job and during the second half I committed myself fully to the course.Here are the pros the vital benefits of the boot camp:
	I attribute what I know as a developer to this program and if I had to learn what I learned on my own with no assistance I imagine it would have taken much longer (honestly a year or more). The guiding nature of this program brings you tricks tips and best practices which are small individually but over the length of the course they add up to make you a strong and well-rounded junior developer.Also please take the course seriously. It will be so easy to slack off. Imagine if you were NOT paying attention in the first few weeks; because the concepts build on each other you basically have to do some extreme catch-up OR you lose all the value you can get out of the program due to your stupidity.

I was in the same boat about 9-10 months ago searching for a place where I could learn something entirely new to help change my life around.  Fresh out of highschool I was accepted into Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's computer engineering program I thought I would be able to keep up but I soon had to drop out due to my grades and other difficulties.  Shortly after I spent 4 years getting a bachelors degree in IT and working customer service/help desk jobs not being able to break into the industry doing what I wanted to do for the next few years. After changing direction and doing web design for 6 months I appreciated the work I did with that and wanted to pursue that but only found out (at the time) in order to get into web design and development you needed a Computer Science/Engineering degree.  I kept hearing this everywhere I went so I did research and wanted to go back to school but since I already had a bachelors degree alot of places were limited and would not let me apply.  Schools not for everybody I guess right?It was then I heard about coding bootcamps but of course there was a trail of negativity and stereotypes behind them.  I looked into SO many but none of them really fit what I was trying to accomplish or I couldn't afford them or I couldn't attend full time due to other obligations.  But there comes a time in your life when you need to drop all your excuses forget everyone elses opinions and just go for it. I spoke with Alex to address all of my concerns about bootcamps what I will be learning possible career options and much more.  Alex was very helpful and answered all of my questions patiently (I think we spoke for over an hour).  After talking with Alex I was a little more at ease about the program but still somewhat skeptical. I needed to just jump in and do it.What was great about this program was that it wasn't a WYSIWYG: it was a dynamic challenging frustrating tiring fun and emotional experience (for me at least).  I didn't just learn \'Full Stack Flex Development\' or just strictly Javascript I was taught In conclusion you're going to find a lot of places and hear a lot of things.  The decision is yours but I am highly recommending The Coding Bootcamp at UCLA Extension because of my experience and outcome. ",480,0

You learn enough to have a basic “working” knowledge of each language.  You must take that and go deeper into the languages yourself. This is really at any bootcamp because there is so much taught in a short time.  Overall I was happy with the academic portion of the class.  It was challenging but I had great teachers.....HOWEVER.....if you are like me and many of the students who take this course with the intention of finding a job after....I MUST WARN YOU......the career services is completely aweful....they promise a lot of things throughout the course and very little of them happened...... I hope that they improve this for the students sake....but as of now....CAREER SERVICES IS A JOKE.....you would be better off not even using them.....This has been my experience and that of many of my fellow students.... ",194,0

Although it is true that with this course you get out of it what you put into it there is a great deal of support from the instructor and the teaching assistants. You aren't left alone and if you are struggling with a concept they will work hard to make sure you really understand the subject matter. For example they don't just help you debug they will explain the underlying reason for the bug (often not at all obvious) and make sure you have the tools to better find bugs in the future.The most pleasant surprise for me in taking this course was how much the instructor and TAs loved the subject matter and wanted us the students to really understand it.The curriculum is intended to prepare you for real programming work. It does teach you how to create a full website from the front-end to the database.I worked full-time while taking this course but I had some advantages in having past experience as a software developer (and with computers in general). I think that if computer programming is completely foreign to you it would be better to take this course without working full-time at the same time. But if programming and computer science aren't completely foreign topics it's possible to work full-time and take this course. Either way be sure to get plenty of sleep.",254,0

The class was HARD no joke when they tell you the pace is fast believe them...it's FAST!However if you hold on for the ride and just embrace it you will come out at the end with a huge foundation of knowledge. I've talked to several developer friends who are very impressed with the material I've learned (the volume and also the fact that the material is actually relevant and currently in high demand within the industry).My instructor was great...personable knowledgable funny easy to talk to he was always available to answer questions or re-explain a concept. He really made the class fun...I always looked forward to it. Plus we had two TA's in our class and I had a personal tutor I met with on Zoom every week (included in the program). I also really loved the connections I made with my fellow students we bonded quickly and were always helping each other out as well. Plenty of resources were made available when we needed extra help.I am not yet an expert (I had zero experience with web dev when I started) but I have a really solid foundation now. There are concepts I need to review again I need to keep learning but there's A LOT that I know how to do and that feels amazing!This experience will be what you make of it...you will need to put in a lot of work outside of class time. Everyone is different but I would have had a very difficult time keeping up with class if I had been working full time. Do yourself a favor and get a head start with webistes like W3Schools.com and freecodecamp.org...especially if you're a newbie. That is something I wish I would have done it would have really helped to atleast be familiar with terms and concepts before day one. The only not great experience for me was career services...but again this is what you make of it. We never got a chance to meet the career people in person and that doesn't work with my personality. I felt they were removed and not really a part of the whole experience. Because of this I didn't participate fully in this aspect of the class. I'm sure if I had tried harder I would have gotten more out of it...but I just never felt a connection with those folks so it wasn't all that helpful to me.Overall I am 100% glad I took this class zero regrets.

UNC CHAPEL HILL,TRILOGY,5/2/2018,    Full Stack Flex ,    Raleigh , LinkedIn,5,5,5,4,"Short and simple version:Great boot camp. It's tough there's a lot of material and it will require a lot of discipline and work on your part. That being said it'll take you from 0 to professional entry level developer in 6 months if you put in the work into two areas: 1) Learning/practicing the material and 2) building your professional presence. In my opinion and experience it is worth the cost and time. I secured a Software Engineering job less than 1 month after graduation. Prior to the course I had 0 dev experience.Long version:This is a great boot camp for anybody looking to switch careers or just to learn HTML CSS and JavaScript (specifically JavaScript - this is a JavaScript intensive course. There is 1 week on C# but the vast majority of libraries frameworks and tech in this course is centered around JS.). Not only that the layout enables you to keep your job while the course is underway. The teachers and TAs are all very knowledgable and the class room setting is great as well. Tons of activities paired programming and a few projects really drive home the material. Our Student Success Manager and Career Advisor were also great and helpful. I came in with no prior coding experience so the first month was the most difficult for me just to grasp the basics of HTML CSS and JavaScript. After that first month of getting used to the class and homeworks and also learning on my own outside of class (Udemy.com - outside learning is important) you kinda hit a groove and start picking up the more complex stuff quicker and having a bunch of those 'aha' moments. It's amazing today to see the apps I can build in only 6 months of training.I'm a skeptical person. I definitely had my skepticism about paying for this course and wondering if the investment would pay off in a job in 6 months...seemed too good to be true. At the end of the day it's up to you and your effort/drive as to whether or not the investment will pay off. I have a few friends from the course that are now successfully in dev jobs - so this definitely will prepare you for dev roles and companies definitely do hire boot camp graduates. LinkedIn recruiters will reach out to you frequently once you get towards the end of the course. To me (I was in finance prior to my career change) any investment where I can completely control the rate of return is a great one. If you have the drive and desire to put in the time I highly recommend the UNC Coding Boot Camp.",446,0

But if you are willing to put the hours in every single week (30 - 40+) you will succeed and be on the way to new levels of personal and career success and opportunity. I just finished the boot camp and would totally do it again! In fact I loved it so much I begin TA'ing for the program next week! If you want to take a chance at a better life and want to push yourself to put the work in and learn the technologies presented in class the decision to take the boot camp is a no brainer! ",137,1

The class was HARD no joke when they tell you the pace is fast believe them...it's FAST!However if you hold on for the ride and just embrace it you will come out at the end with a huge foundation of knowledge. I've talked to several developer friends who are very impressed with the material I've learned (the volume and also the fact that the material is actually relevant and currently in high demand within the industry).My instructor was great...personable knowledgable funny easy to talk to he was always available to answer questions or re-explain a concept. He really made the class fun...I always looked forward to it. Plus we had two TA's in our class and I had a personal tutor I met with on Zoom every week (included in the program). I also really loved the connections I made with my fellow students we bonded quickly and were always helping each other out as well. Plenty of resources were made available when we needed extra help.I am not yet an expert (I had zero experience with web dev when I started) but I have a really solid foundation now. There are concepts I need to review again I need to keep learning but there's A LOT that I know how to do and that feels amazing!This experience will be what you make of it...you will need to put in a lot of work outside of class time. Everyone is different but I would have had a very difficult time keeping up with class if I had been working full time. Do yourself a favor and get a head start with webistes like W3Schools.com and freecodecamp.org...especially if you're a newbie. That is something I wish I would have done it would have really helped to atleast be familiar with terms and concepts before day one. The only not great experience for me was career services...but again this is what you make of it. We never got a chance to meet the career people in person and that doesn't work with my personality. I felt they were removed and not really a part of the whole experience. Because of this I didn't participate fully in this aspect of the class. I'm sure if I had tried harder I would have gotten more out of it...but I just never felt a connection with those folks so it wasn't all that helpful to me.Overall I am 100% glad I took this class zero regrets. I have gained SO much knowledge met so many great people and I know that I have the skills I need to get a job I love and earn a great living! ",461,0

UNC CHAPEL HILL,TRILOGY,5/2/2018,    Full Stack Flex ,    Raleigh , LinkedIn,5,5,5,4,"Short and simple version:Great boot camp. It's tough there's a lot of material and it will require a lot of discipline and work on your part. That being said it'll take you from 0 to professional entry level developer in 6 months if you put in the work into two areas: 1) Learning/practicing the material and 2) building your professional presence. In my opinion and experience it is worth the cost and time. I secured a Software Engineering job less than 1 month after graduation. Prior to the course I had 0 dev experience.Long version:This is a great boot camp for anybody looking to switch careers or just to learn HTML CSS and JavaScript (specifically JavaScript - this is a JavaScript intensive course. There is 1 week on C# but the vast majority of libraries frameworks and tech in this course is centered around JS.). Not only that the layout enables you to keep your job while the course is underway. The teachers and TAs are all very knowledgable and the class room setting is great as well. Tons of activities paired programming and a few projects really drive home the material. Our Student Success Manager and Career Advisor were also great and helpful. I came in with no prior coding experience so the first month was the most difficult for me just to grasp the basics of HTML CSS and JavaScript. After that first month of getting used to the class and homeworks and also learning on my own outside of class (Udemy.com - outside learning is important) you kinda hit a groove and start picking up the more complex stuff quicker and having a bunch of those 'aha' moments. It's amazing today to see the apps I can build in only 6 months of training.I'm a skeptical person. I definitely had my skepticism about paying for this course and wondering if the investment would pay off in a job in 6 months...seemed too good to be true. At the end of the day it's up to you and your effort/drive as to whether or not the investment will pay off. I have a few friends from the course that are now successfully in dev jobs - so this definitely will prepare you for dev roles and companies definitely do hire boot camp graduates. LinkedIn recruiters will reach out to you frequently once you get towards the end of the course. To me (I was in finance prior to my career change) any investment where I can completely control the rate of return is a great one. If you have the drive and desire to put in the time I highly recommend the UNC Coding Boot Camp.",446,0

I'm glad I took this Bootcamp -- it is head and shoulders above the alternatives. The Bootcamp's strong points are these:
	To conclude this is a professionally run and supported Bootcamp that provides a quality educational experience focused on currently-relevant software technology. There are of course a few improvements I'd make -- more focus on ES6 Javascript React.js Angular and removing the C# module.  But these are nits. I know that Trilogy Ed who runs the course is always trying to improve it. I'm confident it will continue to provide excellent relevant training.If you fully participate in every class and do all the homework you will acquire solid software development tools.

You learn enough to have a basic “working” knowledge of each language.  You must take that and go deeper into the languages yourself. This is really at any bootcamp because there is so much taught in a short time.  Overall I was happy with the academic portion of the class.  It was challenging but I had great teachers.....HOWEVER.....if you are like me and many of the students who take this course with the intention of finding a job after....I MUST WARN YOU......the career services is completely aweful....they promise a lot of things throughout the course and very little of them happened......

Although it is true that with this course you get out of it what you put into it there is a great deal of support from the instructor and the teaching assistants. You aren't left alone and if you are struggling with a concept they will work hard to make sure you really understand the subject matter. For example they don't just help you debug they will explain the underlying reason for the bug (often not at all obvious) and make sure you have the tools to better find bugs in the future.The most pleasant surprise for me in taking this course was how much the instructor and TAs loved the subject matter and wanted us the students to really understand it.The curriculum is intended to prepare you for real programming work. It does teach you how to create a full website from the front-end to the database.I worked full-time while taking this course but I had some advantages in having past experience as a software developer (and with computers in general). I think that if computer programming is completely foreign to you it would be better to take this course without working full-time at the same time.
